    "> A Decade of ''Increase and Diffusion\" S. DILLON RIPLEY This is the tenth Annual Report of the Institution which I have had the honor to prepare.",
    "In these years it has been a surcease to find how stable the aspects of the Smithsonian have been which match the needs of the people. \"",
    "Increase and diffusion/' that tantalizing phrase, continues to be our watchword.",
    "We attempt to adhere steadily to cer- tain goals, and to eschew transitory fads.",
    "This past year in Washington has been one of a kind of misty sus- pension, like the haze that hangs over the river bottom in the early mornings spring and fall, in our famous marshes of reclaimed land, known as 'Toggy Bottom.\"",
    "This curious state of suspense has been somewhat akin to sitting in an operating theatre, although the sur- geons were invisible and the body only faintly lighted in a penumbral shade, waiting for the eclipse to go away.",
    "Day by day there were con- flicting sounds, adumbrations which swirled about us through the medium of the news.",
    "The shadows lengthened during the year as if the operation was too long and the body might turn into a cadaver.",
    "But later the pall eased, we breathed again, realizing that the patient would recover, the body politic was alive after all.",
    "For in the process we all survived.",
    "The surgery had not really been directed entirely to any one person.",
    "It has been a kind of psychosurgery or mental vivi- section directed at us all, and in the end we may have emerged better, we hope, for the ordeal.",
    "From the Smithsonian towers we can docu- ment the events, hopeful that in time we can present an objective vi- sion of this segment of the history of our times for those who come to see and learn from our \"diffusion.\"",
    "In science the Smithsonian's research, our \"increase,\" continues in the study of the natural world about us, the objects of creation on the land, the seas, and the phenomena they enclose; and the planets, the measuring of our Earth against them, the Sun and its effect upon us/j and the steady tabulation of the phenomena of outer space.",
    "In history we continue with our encyclopaedic endeavors in the history of American culture and the preservation of that history; whether by conserving the objects or the processes of creation which they represent.",
    "In art we continue to follow our mandate to preserve, collect, ex- hibit, and encourage the study of American art, its roots in the rest of the world, and its current evolution.",
    "With the present interest of our government in sponsoring and supporting the arts and humanities, a new partnership, in theme at least, begins to emerge.",
    "Although sepa- rate, the Smithsonian maintains common interests and close ties withi the National Endowments for the Arts and for the Humanities.",
    "Both share common tasks, and both work together progressively through the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities.",
    "This is especially important in the forthcoming events of the Bicentennial years.",
    "In ad- dition there is much to interest the Endowments in the new art mu- seum opening on the Mall in October, 1974, and in the burgeoning; studies in art and art history being undertaken by the various Smith- sonian enterprises, as well as in the living Folk Festivals.",
    "What a, celebration of the American Spirit these Endowments have become, and how vital their part in encouraging American creativity as well as; cultural history and research!",
    "All of which is to say that like the Endowments the Smithsonian is< alive and well, whether in science or in art, and that each year its; purposes and its services are becoming increasingly apparent and: comprehensible to our people.",
    "As the Institution becomes more un- derstood so the morale of its staff improves.",
    "We all realize the impor- tance to our citizens of what we are doing, and this improves our own\" quality and our dedication.",
    "So be it.",
    "j As we become more important to people, our visitors increase, ouri memberships in the Associates increase, our magazine and related^ publications and benefits reach out further and further (our member-?",
    "ships now are 622,000) and so our responsibilities to be true to ouri goals and to increase and diffuse knowledge become more evident.",
    "Our obligations to ourselves for standards and quality have not*' changed, but these very traditions of ours become more visible.",
    "As;, this happens, we pay a kind of penalty \u2014 that of being noticed.",
    "For years I had thought many of the things that the Smithsonian just, 4 / Smithsonian Year 1974 went on doing quietly and competently were underappreciated and in effect undervalued.",
    "Our knowledge about the environment of the planet and our knowledge of the solar system seemed to me so com- prehensive that I was disturbed that more people did not know about all this, or that only those in cloistered circles were party to our work and failed to noise it abroad.",
    "Now with our new exposure there is by contrast a penalty to popularity.",
    "It is what I used to call \"joining the cold shower club.\"",
    "By becoming noticed one becomes the subject of curiosity, sometimes the object of criticism, or even envy (if doing things well).",
    "We are, I am sure, prepared to pay the penalty for con- tinuing to do well what we are charged with doing, and to that we can say, amen.",
    "Suffice it to affirm that we will continue to prepare to play host to an increment of several million visitors a year who come in spite of the obstacles of traffic, outmoded transportation, increasing costs, and stultifying living and travel handicaps.",
    "And we will continue to fight for their right to come in spite of obstacles placed in their way by time and circumstance.",
    "For we know that it is in the interests of the people and their increasing desire to know themselves that they should come and see our Institution, and we know that in this we Kave the support and the enthusiasm of the Congress who continue to find the work of the Smithsonian refreshing.^ Last year I wrote a good deal about the Bicentennial and the Smith- sonian's essential activities in the long-past Centennial of 1876, Vleanwhile, sparked by the new administration under John Warner, the 1976 Bicentennial approaches with every breath we breathe, and bur own preparations for '76 wax apace.",
    "Our first major Portrait Gal- ery exhibition has opened to critical acclaim.",
    "Our renovations of the \\rts and Industries Building have started in order to make it an evoc- \\ ^ Professor Wilcomb Washburn reminds me of a diary entry of Congressman ienry L. Dawes of Massachusetts who came to Washington to serve in 1852, ind speaks of the Institution \u2014 \"The Smithsonian Institute is the noblest of all monuments ever erected in he United States.",
    "Washington lives in the affections and reverence of his coun- rymen justly before all others and the great monument going up to his memory s in a corresponding degree an object of interest. (",
    "The Washington Monument vas still under construction.)",
    "But the Institute is at once a monument and an ingine of power, a fountain of knowledge, a bulwark for the preservation of he liberties Washington bequeathed.",
    "It has been founded and is rising in grand ofty proportions 'for the diffusion of knowledge among men.'",
    "And so long as t shall fulfill its mission fears are idle \u2014 Man will be free.\"",
    "Statement hy the Secretary I 5 ative setting of what the Centennial of 1876 was all about.",
    "Addition- ally we are planning on a strong effort to accon^modate our visitors with guidance, information, food, protection, and a sense of wel- come and enthusiastic reception.",
    "i A whole series of things \u2014 exhibits, happenings, publications, tes- I taments to human curiosity, and just plain fun \u2014 will be awaiting ; them in 1976, not least of which will be an entire new museum dedi- i cated to America's single and most salutary technological achieve- ; ment, an achievement which has helped to expand and rework our ; culture in all its ramifications, the conquest of air and space.",
    "Can | there be any insentient people alive today in this country who do not realize that the conquest of air, and now of space, has changed our perspectives, our culture, indeed our ethos?",
    "In essence increasingly rapid modes of flight have abolished time, pressed the concept of communications close to human tolerance through the continuing evolution of the computer, helped to abolish faith, and prepared us for a new and as yet uncharted way of viewing the human condition.",
    "America, I hope, will be thinking of 2076 by the time the Bicenten- nial comes along.",
    "And in that connection we might as well have a look at the panorama showing how we reached our present predica- ment.",
    "Our untrammeled will to succeed, to better our style of life through our communication and transport, has put us where we are.",
    "We could call our Air and Space Museum last year's Pandora's Box, and looking in visualize what we had better do about next year's.",
    "For we have not stopped the clock in the past, and if we are to slow it ; down in the future we will have to realize what has been happening to make so much of that future inevitable.",
    "In his recent (1974) short book, Robert Heilbroner questions the continued hegemony of organized science under the present threat of a new Dark Age for our \\ civilization.",
    "That we face the possibility of a new Dark Age in history is evident to many.",
    "As an ecologist, I have found the recent discus- 1 sions of economists and social scientists on the subject of the inter- dependence of population trends and the use of natural resources, | agriculture, industrial growth, and pollution, a kind of coming home to roost, neo-Malthusian thinking caught up with Volterra-Gause hypotheses of strategies of competition in nature.",
    "Heilbroner believes that science and technology have developed in an inimical manner to foster runaway population, cataclysmic wars, and environmental degradation without compensating restraints and standards, includ 6 / Smithsonian Year 1974 ing moral and ethical controls.",
    "He postulates that religion will and must rise again to insure the reawakening of civilization itself.",
    "As with a see-saw, he envisages science losing its paramountcy as reli- gion arises once more.",
    "This to me is overly simplistic.",
    "An economist can afford perhaps to be an agnostic, but most philosophically in- clined scientists \u2014 physicists (who perforce must be philosophers), molecular biologists, and the best of the ecologists \u2014 will tell you that they hold to an essential faith in laws of creation, which are indeed the moral and ethical presumption on which religion is based.",
    "What- ever limits to creation we may have plumbed, it is a popular fiction to assume that in the process scientists have destroyed our faith.",
    "All of which is not to say that it is not worthwhile to have men of the caliber of Heilbroner, as social scientists, becoming aware of eco- logical principles.",
    "Jan Tinbergen, winner of the Nobel prize in eco- nomics, told me recently that he owed a great part of his somewhat unorthodox theoretical assumptions to new insights he had gained from his brother Nikolaas, a Nobel prize winner in biological medi- cine, who is a pioneer in the study of the behavior of animals under field conditions, away from laboratory controls, where they are guided by and demonstrate ecological principles.",
    "It is sad that the social sciences have classically paid so little attention to the broad truths of ecology.",
    "In the past year we had the novel experience of the turning off of the taps which supply our gasoline pumps, and Americans \u2014 repre- senting six percent of the world's population but conditioned to gobbling up nearly forty percent of the world's resources \u2014 are just now beginning to get the message.",
    "Our massive indifference to in- ternational bureaux and offices talking about one-world politics, eco- nomics, and world interdependence has been conditioned over the years by the perfect conviction that being an American is a natural condition v 'hich we assume carries with it all the perquisites of tech- nological superiority over our fellow inhabitants of the planet.",
    "No matter that there are inequities in the United States itself \u2014 we know that also \u2014 but what many citizens, temporarily enraged by such in- equities, overlook is our commonly held assumption, all of us, that the automobile and the open road, the shopping center, and the fan- tastic and dazzling distribution of material goods at all levels is a natural right.",
    "As Americans, either richer or poorer, we have it way over eighty percent of the rest of the people of the world.",
    "Statement by the Secretary I 7 Whether we deserve it all or not seldom gives us pause, although last winter's threat of gas rationing was at least a temporary aberra- tion in the hiatus between winter holidays and summer vacation.",
    "Now that the gas taps have turned on again, it is easy to believe that all's right with the world once more.",
    "It is easy to forget the unpleas- antness of the spectre of declining resources.",
    "In this state of vague malaise the conviction has come to many younger and also minority group members that the survival of the Republic is uncertain.",
    "Whereas historians or political scientists glori- fied the successes of America, based on the application of intelli- gence, others such as Jean-Fran(;:ois Revel now describe what is hap- pening in America as a revolution, which indeed it is.",
    "But we can take heart in his definition of revolution, provided ethics survive, for in the process we may approach a truer mode of life and an understand- ing of what we are about.",
    "I have written before of what the Smith- [ sonian could provide as a means of exhibiting this process of under- standing.",
    "I feel it could be done in what I have called a Museum of the Family of Man, a synthesis of thinking about man's place in the universe.",
    "People in the United States have come full circle in their ideas.",
    "Two generations ago and more the thought was that this new frontier, this boundless Nation, would serve as a melting pot wherein all would be remade into an indigenous American mold.",
    "Here all the nations would provide of their best, most daring, and adventurous spirits, who, in this heady atmosphere of opportunity, would become blended into what de Tocqueville and others thought of as the new American breed.",
    "The romantic spirit, descendant of the philosophical idealism of the spirit of the revolutions, took no account of the remainder of the native Americans, that remnant which thoughtful men at the time of the Nation's Centennial had feared would have gone extinct by the twentieth century.",
    "Nor were the blacks or Mexican-Americans con- sidered.",
    "Eighty years later, by the 1930s, the Indian population was recovering from its doldrums of the turn of the century, the Mexican and Latin American minorities were increasing in the Southwest and in the eastern urban centers, and the blacks \u2014 Raymond Pearl had prophesied that the black population would disappear for genetic reasons in two hundred years or so.",
    "Instead of homogenization we now, approaching our Bicentennial, celebrate ethnic diversity and 8 / Smithsotzian Year 1974 cultural pluralism.",
    "Whether our blacks or other minority types with recognizable physical features disappear or not is moot.",
    "Black is beautiful and the liberated American today eschews the melting pot and embraces the reawakened realization that traditions of old ways persist in the New World, that song, dance, drama, the arts, lan- guage \u2014 all the stuff of culture \u2014 continue to exist, to be perpetu- ated in strongly persistent patterns.",
    "We cannot entirely forget our cultural heritage even as a multiplicity of physical types remains permanent in our midst.",
    "Perhaps then we have learned a lesson that biologists of years ago would have been tempted to support, that blending inheritance is far more rare than the persistence of basic traits and types, and that cultural patterns mirror in their persever- ance these physical verities.",
    "Under the circumstances, it is appropriate that the Smithsonian, too, should come full circle.",
    "We can create a summing up of the American experience, a synthesis of all that we have learned, the in- teractions of man on this part of the planet, the interface between ourselves and our environment.",
    "A Museum of the Family of Man then would include certain demonstrable American themes, includ- ing the history of the United States folk, who had come here, when and how, and how this had changed the land and sea and air, its past and present face.",
    "Hopefully, such an illumination of our times could i include, with the aid of computer systems and current technology, an i informed projection of our evolution, both physically and culturally, into the future, our own \"Brave New World.\"",
    "More importantly, as my colleague Under Secretary Brooks has emphasized, such a museum must suggest the continuing process of man's evolution as a creator.",
    "As he phrases it, \"From all the testa- ments of man's creativity, we can recognize at least two kinds of multi-millennial chains of men and women who have created things, technique^;, or concepts relating to the physical world.",
    "The first kind is in its important phase pre-literate and inventive; it has evolved the basic physical conditions of human society and survival \u2014 as for in- stance the cultivation of grains, domestication of animals, shelter, mobility, etc.",
    "The second kind of succession is post-literate and con- ceptual; it has evolved understanding of the world, the universe, man's own nature, and the structures of thought itself.",
    "The two have common ground but different approaches to understanding, and de- serve equal honor.",
    "They proceed in common from man's bio-psycho- Statement by the Secretary I 9 logical heritage \u2014 his visual brain, manual dexterity, capacity for use of symbols and language.\"",
    "To suggest the process means, of course, to avoid the static quality of museums encompassed in arrays of finite objects, but rather to formulate a kind of multimedia display, \"engaging the viewer's own processes of thought and imagination.\"",
    "The process is a speed-up process too.",
    "From the unique fact that evolution provided the tools, man's ability to communicate effectively, and the evolution of man- ual dexterity, has come the unfolding of brain integration in these functions.",
    "Each system has buffered and supported the other, devel- oping an end product unlike any other known on the planet.",
    "Thus the diverging into the two types of creativity: the technologies of sur- vival and the evolution of thought.",
    "In this latter aspect of creativity there are the social inventions: \"elaborations upon the family, the tribe, the state, the organs of justice, legislation, administration, caste, class, trade, education, war.\"",
    "Then there is the invention of social institutions, \"and the creators who formulated social thought and promoted social action.\"",
    "These historical creations are all rooted in man's biological heritage as well, and of course have speeded up enormously along with the evolution of technology.",
    "In any discussion of process it is instructive to speculate about the possibility, achieved five years ago, of landing a man on the moon.",
    "Although the technologies existed to create orbiting machines in space, James Webb has pointed out to me that the human factor, the men who could manipulate the machines effectively enough to land themselves on the lunar surface, and then blast off again to join up with their circling companion, must have been brought up from childhood in an atmosphere where the commonplaces of advanced technology all worked.",
    "Communication by telephone, for example, is randomly so taken for granted in the U.S.A., because the telephones work so relatively perfectly, that we are brought up and accustomed to have perfect transmittal of ideas or mechanical concepts in using them.",
    "We do not have to have meetings or conferences face to face.",
    "Our generations of people are thus habituated for learning and the transfer of vital information in a way that a considerable part of the rest of the world's population is not, or has not been until very re- cently indeed.",
    "Thus the time lags implicit in technological condition- ing and familiarity make for different phased levels of assimilation of the processes of learning.",
    "The chances, therefore, are that only 10 / Smithsonian Year 1974 one particular segment of peoples or culture may be capable of land- ing on the moon at any one time.",
    "And I might add, at the risk of sounding complacent or overweening, that even the prospect of a perfect link-up in space as between the products of two cultures, our own and the U.S.S.R.'s, may be more difficult because of the back- ground and training of the participants than our global strategists and politicians would wish.",
    "This is one example of a truism in contemplating the history of the family of man.",
    "No one group or segment of man, through the biolog- ical and physical phenomena of geographical isolation, is exactly like any other at points in time, as well as through the panorama of his- tory, thus horizontally as well as vertically in a diagrammatic sense.",
    "No museums have ever entirely encompassed all of the philosophical and moral and physical implications which have resulted in our com- plex world.",
    "It is a new way of looking at a subject that goes back to ideas expressed in the last century, vested in the creation of the Musee de I'Homme in Paris in 1877.",
    "Unfortunately the Musee de I'Homme was an anthropology museum, and as I have said else- where,^ until very recently it had been thought, rather uncomfort- ably, that anthropology, being a kind of biological discipline, should concentrate on early man and the present so-called primitive races of man, leaving Western civilization to the classicists and the stu- dents of folk history and the decorative arts.",
    "This situation has now begun to change.",
    "In Washington we are thinking of drawing from everything that our museums, whether of natural history, history of science, culture and technology, or art museums, are exhibiting, each in its own way.",
    "We are concerned here with a new concept, a syn- thesis of the whole family of man and how it got that way.",
    "Interestingly enough we are not alone in this idea.",
    "We claim no hegemony, of course.",
    "At the 1974 meeting of the International Coun- cil of Museums held in Copenhagen, Mme.",
    "Nelly Motrocilova of the Academy in Moscow, speaking on June 3rd, announced that the U.S.S.R. too was thinking of the creation of a Museum of Man.",
    "Suffice it to say that we shall be threshing out this concept over the next year or two with ourselves, our committees such as the Smith- sonian Council, and individual colleagues, with the hope that eventu- Ripley, Dillon.",

    "Statement by the Secretary 1 11 ally we can present a plan to the Congress for a new kind of museum which could somehow embody the dreams of their constituencies across this land, the realization by people of the United States that their strength lies in the strength of their origins, their diversity and the pride, courage, and hope that this can and must give them.",
    "Let there be no despair then but a reasoned pride, measured with cour- age and tempered with the sobering responsibilities that such self- knowledge brings.",
    "The soothsayers and necromancers of today adjure the young to think of themselves first, to cultivate their id, to think first of \"happiness\" in a subjective sense.",
    "They have forgotten, and the young with them, that they are not alone, but that within themselves rests all the history of man.",
    "The Institution's \"increase,\" its research progress in history, the arts, and the sciences, is listed in Smithsonian Year 1974.",
    "Suffice it to say that both in astronomy and astrophysics, work under Director George Field is taking form in programs of great promise, particu- larly in regard to new observations of the Sun made during the flight of the Orbiting Space Laboratory in the past year.",
    "Additionally, suc- cessful research and construction proceeds in concert with the Uni- versity of Arizona on the multiple-mirror telescope.",
    "In the National Museum of Natural History a vigorous new array of exhibits is in the planning stage under the direction of Dr. Porter Kier.",
    "Temperate and tropical environmental studies are being vigorously pursued at our stations in the United States as well as in Panama.",
    "In the latter, significant efforts to enhance the staff as well as the inventory-taking capability of the stations should begin to narrow the gap between what we know about the New World tropics and what limits to tolerance they possess in the face of man's destructive abilities.",
    "For in the vast New World tropics where, contrary to con- ventional wisdom, perhaps only ten percent of the land is susceptible to agriculture, there is precious little time to measure the norms of the tropical environment.",
    "Human population pressure is seeing to that, be it for better or worse.",
    "Few biologists could argue that any- thing that is happening in the tropics today is for the better, but their voices will not be heard in the tendentious political clamour of the developing world.",
    "At the very least we hope that the data we gather will serve as a guide to the essential diversity of the tropical environ- ment and as an indicator for the future of the riches we seem about to forsake so willfully.",
    "The recent remarks on May 29th by the new 12 / Smithsonian Year 1974 President of Venezuela, Carlos Andres Perez, concerning that coun- try's proposed national policy on conservation of natural resources are splendid, however.",
    "If Latin America, with some of the poorest soils in the world, could heed President Perez' speech then biologists could breathe easier.",
    "Finally in the realm of science, a great step forward this past year has been the beginning of the National Zoo's breeding project and reserve at Front Royal, Virginia.",
    "Here is a conservation project in a superb setting, which we hope will become a model of its kind, with room for cooperation with zoological societies all over the country.",
    "In history our staff has collected the Institution's first Pulitzer prize in the person of Professor Daniel Boorstin and his third volume on The Americans: The Democratic Experience.",
    "All of us can take pride in the outstanding historicoliterate achievements of this fa- mous historian, who has resumed work as a Senior Historian after four busy years as Director of the National Museum of History and Technology.",
    "In this latter capacity he has been succeeded by another eminent historian.",
    "Professor Brooke Hindle, sometime Dean, Arts and Sciences, University College, at New York University, and head of that university's Department of History for many years.",
    "Mr. Hindle is particularly an historian of science, and his coming is a matter of great joy to all of us.",
    "In the Museum of History and Technology this year we have also celebrated the creation of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Institute for Historical Research \u2014 a center for studies in the origins of war and peace, headed by Professor Forrest C. Pogue, one of the preeminent military historians of our time.",
    "This is a splendid augury for the Na- tional Armed Forces Museum Advisory Board and may well be its most salient contribution to the preservation of military history.",
    "In the past year the Freer Gallery has celebrated its semicentennial with three splendid exhibitions accompanied by internationally at- tended symposia, as well as the publication of lucid and beautifully illustrated catalogues, and with the awarding of three Freer medals.",
    "No one could fail to be heartened by the renewed interest in Chinese, Japanese, and Islamic art which these exhibitions underscored.",
    "Over 200 scholars and students attended the colloquia, which were in- tensely interesting and of high scholarly caliber.",
    "A symptom of the universal importance placed on art in Japan was a special visit during his stay in Washington by Prime Minister K. Tanaka.",
    "Statement by the Secretary 1 13 ( The National Portrait Gallery continued its striking series of his- torical exhibits with a splendid exhibition and accompanying histori- cal resource document, a catalogue on the Black Presence in the American Revolution.",
    "Once again the Portrait Gallery has charted a new and authoritative course in untraveled seas.",
    "I believe it is ob- vious by now to most historians that this technique of exhibition and wholly definitive catalogues is a new and unsuspected teaching tool to remind us, as I have said earlier, that within us all resides the history of man.",
    "The National Collection of Fine Arts has continued its imaginative program of exhibits, including a revealing one on the history of the plastic arts in recent time in the Pacific Northwest.",
    "I personally was much moved by the evidence from the paintings of the expression via palette tonalities of the difference between living in Oregon and in Washington.",
    "Even in abstracts or in interiors the painters were reflecting a subtle neo-tradition not only of style but of color, evi- dence of the mood and atmosphere, the light and color of the two States.",
    "What reflections cannot be drawn on the origins of ethnicity, of phenotypic differences, of cultural subspeciation in such happenings?",
    "A delightful footnote to the history of American art was the ex- hibition of the work of \"Lilly Martin Spencer: The Joys of Senti- ment,\" the catalogue of which contains a brilliant introduction by Director Joshua Taylor.",
    "The ncfa's collection of American portrait miniatures, one of the best in this country, was placed on permanent exhibition through the generosity of the Trustees of the Merrill Trust.",
    "A special gallery designated the \"Doris M. Magowan Gallery of Portrait Miniatures\" will exhibit these portrait miniatures for the first time.x The substantial completion of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculp- ture Garden in this past year has signaled the arrival of the mam- moth collections of art in Washington and their incipient debut in their new public setting, an event long awaited.",
    "We anticipate for- mally opening the museum on October 1, 1974.",
    "This museum should help to illuminate Joseph Henry's theme that the Mall is indeed a people's park, a place of delight for citizens.",
    "The gloomy myths about the sacred sward and the hallowed ground were no more a part of the original concept of the Republic than any other Victorian Statement by the Secretary I 15 conceits.",
    "The Mall is for all of the citizens of the United States and by no means a cemetery.",
    "In this past year an additional West Coast branch of the Archives of American Art has been opened by our energetic director, WilHam Woolfenden, and the Presidency has been assumed by Dr. Irving Burton after three years of devoted work by Howard Lipman, who now becomes President of the Board of the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York.",
    "We are deeply grateful to all these able workers in the collation of the history of American art.",
    "The Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Decorative Arts and Design in New York continues with its reconstruction plans for the Carnegie Mansion, for which over $1 million has already been raised.",
    "Under the energetic chairmanship of Lewis A. Lapham, who has succeeded Thomas J. Watson, Jr., as Chairman of the National Associates Board, a subcommittee has been formed to enlist the support of New York members, residents, and their wives to complete the reconstruc- tion of the site for our National Museum of Design.",
    "Nearer at home our management enterprises and our reexamina- tion of our structure proceed apace.",
    "In any sensible organization there must come periodic assessments of where one is and where one is going.",
    "In the process of keeping track of our \"fragmented parts which make a whole,\" as Joshua Taylor has described us, we periodi- cally check the pace of our development.",
    "Are we running ourselves ragged with too many activities?",
    "Can we achieve the discipline to confine ourselves to our stated goals before natural accumulations run away with us?",
    "For in the sense of our museums and collections, the Smithsonian is a growth industry.",
    "Perhaps museums are one of the only legitimate growth industries left?",
    "I think we can manage to stay the course by perceiving common themes that unite us intellec- tually, and not simply approach efficient controls as an administra- tive function.",
    "For in our hope to \"increase and diffuse knowledge among men\" lies an ideal as well as a responsible charge.",
    "We monitor the processes continually, firm in our determination to illuminate that ideal.",
    "In the realm of \"diffusion,\" this past year has seen the Smithson- ian undertake a new series of television programs under the direction of David Wolper, with sponsorship by the du Pont Company.",
    "The first program on matters of Smithsonian interest is expected to be re- 16 / Smithsonian Year 1974 leased in November, 1974.",
    "In all of these enterprises with new at- tempts to increase and diffuse knowledge an enormous amount of credit is due to the staff of this Institution, which in its many ramifi- cations continues its devotion and effective assistance to our cause at all levels.",
    "As part of the Smithsonian Product Development program, re- ports indicate that in addition to previously approved craft items, there will be authentic reproductions of pewter, silver, and textiles, all based on existing Smithsonian documentation.",
    "During the past year I have lost two of my friends.",
    "For the ten years of my tenure I have had the perfect conviction of longevity, se- cure in the belief that my three predecessors would be continually available as counsellors and reminders of the continuity of our hopes for the Institution.",
    "As I have noted in Smithsonian (November, 1973, and February, 1974), Dr. Wetmore and I have lost our two col- leagues.",
    "Dr. Leonard Carmichael, my predecessor as Secretary, on September 16, 1973, and Dr. Charles G. Abbot, his immediate prede- cessor as Secretary, on December 17, 1973.",
    "Together we had seemed a continuous chain, reaching back in time to when the Republic itself was less than a century old.",
    "They had helped and encouraged me to celebrate our own Smithson bicentennial in 1965, the 200th Anniver- sary of our Founder's birth, a noble occasion reminding us all of the academic and intellectual links of institutions like our own around the world.",

    "The new Chairman of the National Board of the Smithsonian As- sociates, Mr. Lewis A. Lapham succeeding Mr. Thomas J.

    "Subsequently the Board of Regents, their wives, members of the National Board of the Smithsonian Associates, and the Chairman of the Smithsonian Council gathered for the presentation of the James Smithson Benefactor Medallion to Thomas J. Watson, Jr., for his important contributions to the Smithsonian Institution.",
    "The January 25, 1974, meeting of the Board of Regents was desig- nated The Charles Greeley Abbot Memorial Meeting in tribute to the Smithsonian Institution's fifth Secretary, whose death occurred in December at the age of 101.",
    "Appropriately, the Radiation Biology Laboratory will bear Dr. Abbot's name henceforward, since this as- pect of the Institution's research owes its genesis, in 1929, to Dr. Abbot.",
    "The meeting took place at the Fort Pierce Bureau of the Smith- sonian Institution located at Fort Pierce, Florida, including the Harbor Branch Laboratory, as well as the research barge and the RV Johnson.",

    "Smithsonian Year \u2022 1974 FINANCIAL REPORT T. AMES WHEELER, TREASURER Continued sound progress was shown in Smithsonian finances in fiscal year 1974.",
    "Thanks to increased federal support and further im- provement in results of the Institution's own educational and reve- nue-generating efforts, we were able to cope satisfactorily with the large inflation-bred rise in costs of salaries, supplies, and services, and, at the same time, to strengthen our current operating funds position.",
    "Added federal appropriations enabled us to increase needed museum protection and other support services and to step up prepa- rations for our important 1976 Bicentennial commitments.",

    "In other respects, however, Smithsonian finances can be said to have improved substantially in fiscal year 1974.",
    "Full detail of these results is provided below.",
    "23 Overall Sources and Application of Financial Support The total financial support available to the Institution from all sources is shown in Table 1.",
    "These figures do not include the finances of the National Gallery of Art, the John F.

    "year 1974, an increase of $10,607,000 over the preceding year.",
    "Fed- eral appropriations of $65,063,000 accounted for 7?>.7 percent of the total, research grants and contracts 12.1 percent, and nonfederal in- come 9.2 percent; this ratio of support was roughly the same in fiscal year 1973.",
    "In addition.",
    "Congress provided $21,860,000 in construc- tion funds for continuing work on the National Air and Space Mu- seum, for repairs to other Smithsonian buildings, and for the Na- tional Zoological Park, principally for \"Lion Hill,\" a major beginning on the long-term renovation plan of Zoo facilities.",
    "In Table 2, these revenues from all sources (excluding construction funds and the Special Foreign Currency Program) and their applica- tion to individual Smithsonian bureaus and activities are shown in considerable detail, demonstrating the complexity of funding result- ing from the variety of resources and the large number of diversified services provided.",
    "TEDERAL OPERATING FUNDS Federal appropriations for operating purposes totaled $65,063,000 i including $1,695,000 for the Smithsonian Science Information Ex- change, a separately incorporated organization, and $4,500,000 for ; the Special Foreign Currency Program (in the blocked currency of \u25a0 certain foreign countries).",

    "Financial Report I 29 GRANTS AND CONTRACTS Grants and contracts from federal agencies once again contributed in a major way to the Institution's research programs, predominantly in scientific disciplines.",
    "$9,996,000 of these funds was expended in fiscal year 1974, up from $8,996,000 in fiscal year 1973.",
    "The major recipient, accounting for over half of the total expenditures, con- tinued to be the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cam- bridge, Massachusetts, with grants from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for such projects as the monitoring of Comet Kahoutek, meteor studies, and design of hydrogen maser systems.",
    "Other projects ranged from ecological studies in South America and Asia to research on American folklore.",
    "Table 5 shows the major granting agencies to the Smithsonian over a four-year period, representing several hundred different grants and contracts each year.",
    "PRIVATE TRUST FUNDS Originally established entirely with funds from Mr. Smithson's be- quest, the Institution has, over a long period of years, derived an in- creasing proportion of its support from federal appropriations as it was entrusted with more national collections and expanded its re- search and public exhibitions.",
    "It is now an important goal of Smithsonian administration to bol- ster the Institution's private resources in line with or exceeding the growth of its federal support, in order to restore a better balance be- tween the two, thereby helping to preserve its uniquely flexible and independent character among national establishments.",
    "Despite the many serious economic uncertainties of this past 12-month period, fiscal year 1974 results were in line with this goal.",
    "Receipts (includ- ing those for operating purposes, land acquisition, and building con- struction) from gifts, investment income, revenue-producing activi- ties, fees, and other revenues all increased to record levels, with the total equaling $8,954,000 (not including $105,000 gifts to endow- ment funds).",
    "Of this total $5,598,000 was designated for specific restricted purposes; this latter amount was fractionally higher than in fiscal year 1973, while income for unrestricted purposes rose from , $1,013,000 to $3,356,000 (see Table 6).",

    "UNRESTRICTED PRIVATE FUNDS The substantial increase in unrestricted general purpose private funds in fiscal year 1974 was extremely welcome and enabled the Institution for the first time to reserve private monies for plant im- provements not believed to be obtainable from federal appropria- tions but which will enhance our ability to serve the public and which may, at the same time, lead to increased private support in the years ahead.",
    "The build-up of the general unrestricted fund balance to a more adequate level of $3,067,000 also means that portions of any similar gains in future years may also be used for this purpose or to strengthen our present low endowment reserves.",
    "As may be seen in Table 7, the increase in income before transfers to other funds, equaling $2,336,000 in fiscal year 1974 compared to $688,000 in fiscal year 1973, arose in part from a jump in investment income but, more importantly, from successful results of our educa- tional and revenue-producing activities.",
    "There was, at the same time, a somewhat offsetting rise in administrative costs, partly from salary and other administrative cost increases (including an initial charge of $198,000 to establish a reserve for employees' accrued annual leave), but also reflecting greater assistance to a number of bureaus for special needs and urgent research projects.",
    "The increase in investment income this year resulted primarily from the build-up in working capital and advance Smithsonian mag- azine subscription monies which made more funds available for in- vestment in high quality short-term issues at prevailing high interest rates.",
    "As may be noted on the Balance Sheet, page 48, current fund investments equaled $8,298,000 as of June 30, 1974, compared to $6,223,000 a year earlier; of the former amount, $6,600,000 was invested in very high grade, short-term securities and bank certifi- cates of deposit.",
    "The Smithsonian magazine was responsible for the largest share of the net gain from revenue-producing activities.",
    "As shown in Table 8, its income for the year rose to $1,327,000, from $330,000 in the previous year.",
    "At June 30, 1974, there were 622,000 National Asso- ciate members and subscribers to the magazine, making it one of the fastest growing publications in the Nation.",

    "As an example, the unusually large net gain in unrestricted private funds in fiscal year 1974 coincided with urgent requirements for construction funds, necessitating transfers of $1,134,000 to the Institution's plant funds, with other transfers to Special Purpose funds.",
    "Restricted Funds, and Endowment Funds bringing total trans- fers to $1,561,000 (see Table 7).",

    "A new category of unrestricted private funds (\"Special Purpose\") is set out separately this year, namely, those which are legally un- restricted but which have been designated by management to be re- served for specific uses (see Table 6).",
    "These accounts, previously treated as a part of Restricted Funds, include, for example, receipts from parking at the Zoo (reserved to aid future construction of addi- tional parking facilities for visitors), and revenues from various minor enterprises in individual museums (e.g., charges for tour- guide audiophone equipment, etc.)",
    "and related expenditures of these monies, chiefly for improvement of exhibits.",

    "In addition, it was necessary to transfer $178,000 of private unrestricted funds to Cooper-Hewitt in fiscal year 1974 to eliminate operating deficits accumulated over this and previous years.",
    "In September 1973, at the death of Mrs. Marjorie Merriweather Post, the responsibility for her \"Hillwood\" estate and the extraordi- nary collections it contains passed to the Smithsonian.",

    "Fund Accounting \u2014 In order to ensure observance of limitations and re- strictions placed on the use of the resources available to the Institution, the accounts of the Institution are maintained in accordance with the prin- 52 / Smithsonian Year 1974 ciples of \"fund accounting\".",
    "This is the procedure by which resources for various purposes are classified for accounting and reporting purposes into funds that are in accordance with activities or objectives specified.",
    "Separate accounts are maintained for each fund; however, in the accompanying financial statements, funds that have similar characteristics have been com- bined into fund groups.",
    "Accordingly, all financial transactions have been recorded and reported by fund group.",
    "Within each fund group, fund balances restricted by outside sources are so indicated and are distinguished from unrestricted funds allocated to spe- cific purposes by action of the governing board.",
    "Externally restricted funds may only be utilized in accordance with the purposes established by the source of such funds and are in contrast with unrestricted funds over which the governing board retains full control to use in achieving any of its institutional purposes.",
    "Endowment funds are subject to the restrictions of gift instruments requir- ing in perpetuity that the principal be invested and the income only be utilized.",
    "Also classified as endowment funds are gifts which will allow the expenditure of principal but only under certain specified conditions.",
    "Unrestricted quasi-endowment funds have been established by the govern- ing board for the same purposes as endowment funds, any portion of such funds may be expended.",
    "Restricted quasi-endowment funds represent giftt for restricted purposes where there is no stipulation that the principal be maintained in perpetuity or for a period of time, but the governing board has elected to invest the principal and expend only the income for the pur- pose stipulated by the donor.",
    "All gains and losses arising from the sale, collection, or other disposition of investments and other noncash assets are accounted for in the fund which owned such assets.",
    "Ordinary income derived from investments, re- ceivables, and the like, is accounted for in the fund owning such assets, except for income derived from investments of endowment and similar funds, which income is accounted for in the fund to which it is restricted or, if unrestricted, as revenues in unrestricted current funds.",
    "All other unrestricted revenue is accounted for in the unrestricted current fund.",
    "Restricted gifts, grants, endowment income, and other restricted re- sources are accounted for in the appropriate restricted funds.",
    "c. Investments are recorded at cost or fair market value at date of acquisition when acquired by gift.",
    "d. Inventories are carried at lower of average cost or net realizable value.",
    "e. Income and expenses in respect to the Institution's magazine and associates' activities are deferred and taken into income and expense over the appli- cable periods and are reported in the activities section of the current unrestricted funds.",
    "f. Endowment and Similar Fund Investments \u2014 The Institution utilizes the \"total return\" approach to investment management of endowment funds and quasi-endowment funds.",
    "Under this approach, the total investment return is considered to include realized and unrealized gains and losses in addition to interest and dividends.",
    "In applying this approach, it is the Insti- tution's policy to provide 4V2% of the five year average of the market value of each fund (adjusted for gifts and transfers during this period) as being available for current expenditures; however, where the market value of the assets of any fund is less than 110% of the historic dollar value (value of gifts at date of donation) the amount provided is limited to only interest and dividends received.",

    "Two other colorful and notable exhibits in the Museum's foyer area were the offshoot of the field research trips of two of the Museum's scientists.",
    "One was a display of large, dye-transfer color prints of tropical blossoms photographed in Africa and South Amer- ica by Dr. Edward S. Ayensu, Chairman of the Museum's Depart- ment of Botany (supplemented with pictures by the Museum's scientific photographer, Kjell B. Sandved), the other placed on view ethnological materials from the eastern Himalayan country of Bhu- tan, collected by Dr. Eugene I. Knez, the Museum's Curator of Asian Anthropology.",
    "This exhibit was planned to coincide with the June coronation of Bhutan's 19-year-old king, and included the display of photographs, paintings, textiles, costumes, copper, gold and silver vessels, religious objects, basketry, and pottery.",
    "Among Science I 79 the lenders to the exhibit was Smithsonian Secretary S. Dillon Ripley, who has made several expeditions to Bhutan.",
    "Two Museum physical anthropologists, Drs.",
    "J. Lawrence Angel and Douglas H. Ubelaker, in separate paleodemographic studies in the Old and New Worlds, are amassing evidence of how environ- mental conditions influenced the health, longevity, and evolution of prehistoric man.",
    "Working closely with archeologists who have unearthed grave sites, the two scientists make measurements of ancient skeletal material.",
    "From this they can assemble a body of statistics about an ancient community that includes the size of its population, the age composition, birth rate, sex ratio, number of children born, family size, and critical effects of diseases such as arthritis and malaria \u2014 all of which are determined by diet, climate, living habits, and heredity.",
    "Dr. Angel's work over the last decade has been concentrated on Eastern Mediterranean burial sites such as Catal Hiiyiik, Turkey, where a population of early neolithic hunting farmers and traders, living in a compact pueblo-like community, had conquered the peril of a high child mortality rate \u2014 probably caused by malaria \u2014 by evolving a culture that venerated and protected women.",
    "This had lengthened the lives and childbearing years of the women.",
    "The population of the community had increased as a result, and it had become possible for the women to make a rich contribution to the community's art, crafts, and religious activities, while the men were hunting and trading.",
    "The People of Lerna: An Analysis of a Prehistoric Aegean Popu- lation, published by the Smithsonian Institution Press, is Dr. Angel's study of a site situated on the Bay of Argos, Greece, where archeolo- gists found 235 Bronze Age graves, covering a span of 25 generations (2000-1600 B.C.).",
    "The demographic profile Dr. Angel constructed showed that adults in Lerna (which he estimated had about 800 persons living in it during the Middle Bronze Age) had an average life expectancy of 34 years \u2014 37 for men, 31 for women.",
    "The average woman bore about five children \u2014 2.2 of which grew to adulthood (15 years of age).",
    "On the basis of that birth rate the population was increasing, doubling every 7 to 10 generations.",
    "This was a remarkably successful adaptation to the handicapping diseases afflicting the community.",
    "80 / Smithsonian Year 1974 Mask from the exhibition \"Bhutan: The Land of Dragons.\"",
    "Malaria, in particular, had a crippling impact, just as it had had at Catal Hiiyiik.",
    "The changeover from a hunting to a farming culture, which had begun in the Mediterranean between 9000 to 6500 B.C. with the disappearance of the big game herds, had drawn early farming populations to sites like Lerna where the soil was soft and the forests not established.",
    "But these well-watered marshy areas that favored farming also favored the Anopheles mosquito and the result was that malaria, especially the type known as falciparum malaria, was rampant.",
    "The physical debilitation caused by this disease Science I 81 plagued and weakened Lerna for most of its prehistoric period (the average stature of the Lerna men was only 5' 5V2'' and women, 5' V4 \") .",
    "It was not until later when Greek communities learned how to drain their marshes to gain better control of irrigation and water supply that the numbers of malaria-carrying mosquitos were re- duced, a development reflected in the stature and longevity of the people.",
    "Dr. Angel's colleague, Douglas Ubelaker, has been analyzing skeletal material from a large pre-Columbian cemetery in the Hacienda Ayalan, Guayas Province, on the south coast of Ecuador, dating to a.d.",
    "1300, where 50 large ceramic urns, each containing up to 20 skeletons, were uncovered.",
    "With the approval of the Ecuadorian Government all of this material was shipped back to the Museum, where now, highly accurate microscopic methods of determining age by osteon counts were conducted.",
    "The results were startling.",
    "The population had an average adult age at death of about 67 years, with many individuals living into the eighth and ninth decade, a much higher figure than one would expect for a prehistoric population.",
    "It can be explained by the fact the site provided excellent nutrition.",
    "The people took crops from the land and exploited fresh- and salt- water food resources.",
    "Many of the diseases that historically lower life expectancy (syphilis, malaria, measles, mumps, smallpox) either were nonexistent or were not severe problems until the Spanish arrived.",
    "Furthermore, there is some evidence of remarkable con- temporary longevity along that part of the coast that may have extended back into prehistory.",
    "Stands of Japanese Ma-dake timber bamboo (Phyllostachys bambusoides) are flowering throughout America, a cyclical phenom- enon that takes place only at intervals of 120 years and is as rare to botanists as Halley's comet is to astronomers.",

    "Thomas R. Soderstrom and C. E. Calderon, Museum scientists, have been monitoring this dramatic botanical event.",
    "Last year they asked for help from readers of Smithsonian magazine and the Smithsonian's Environmental Alert Network, which alerted high school science classes all over the country.",
    "Hundreds of persons, young and old, responded by mailing in dried specimens of flowering branches of the bamboo plant and along with it information about precisely where it was collected and photographs and short histories of the 82 / Smithsonian Year 1974 Dr. Thomas R. Soderstrom, Curator of Grasses, Department of Botany, examining specimens of flowering bamboo.",
    "Stands from which it came.",
    "With these data, Drs.",
    "Soderstrom and Calderon were able to draw up a map that pinpoints Ma-dake stands in at least 22 states, showing its heaviest concentrations on the West Coast, from Washington to California, and in the southeastern Gulf states.",
    "Science I 83 The flowering of Ma-dake is always followed by the death of the plant's culms (stems), and this was verified by the volunteer observ- ers.",
    "In cases where the flowering and death cycle had taken place in the late 1960s, they noticed that the old rhizomes (underground stem masses) were regenerating themselves and producing many new but weak, contorted shoots.",
    "Drs.",
    "Soderstrom and Calderon point out that it may take 6 or more years before large, normal shoots are again grown, and perhaps 15 years before the bamboo clump is in the same condition prior to flowering.",
    "In Japan Ma-dake is used as a raw material for the construction of homes, furniture, farm implements, baskets, and even food, and it is easy to under- stand why the cyclical flowering there is considered nothing less than a disaster.",
    "All of the Ma-dake stands do not flower simultaneously because there are a number of time-oriented, hereditary lines, consisting of segregated progeny, distributed throughout the world.",
    "Each of these hereditary lines is on a 120-year cycle.",
    "These cycles began to come to completion in the late 1950s, but most of them in America have done so in the late 1960s.",
    "Drs.",
    "Soderstrom and Calderon predict that the present flowering will end shortly, but will begin again in the 2070s, continue through the 2080s, and terminate in the 2090s.",
    "The covered jars in Dr. Donald R. Davis's laboratory are full of blotched and discolored leaves on which one can see curious lines.",
    "Some of the lines are crooked, some are coiled in a serpentine man- ner, and others strike out in every direction from a central patch, creating a star-shaped pattern.",
    "The leaves were collected by Dr. Davis from the Great Dismal Swamp in Virginia, but they could just as well be from almost any garden, park, or forest in America, The marks on the leaves are the work of leaf miners, insect larvae of minute size that can infest every leaf of a plant or tree and do enough aggregate damage to kill their host.",
    "In Canada, the miners have been so destructive to spruce and fir trees in the Western Provinces in the last few years that the Government has initiated a biological study of these insects in hopes of finding a means of control.",
    "Last year.",
    "Dr. Davis, Curator at the Museum's Department of Entomology, began work on a biosystematic study directed specifically at four important families of leaf-mining Microlepidop- tera (Eriocraniidae, Nepticulidae, Heliozelidae, and Gracillariidea).",
    "84 / Smithsonian Year 1974 Dr. Donald R. Davis, Curator of Lepidoptera, Department of Entomology, examining leaves with tell-tale markings left by leaf miners.",
    "Mining behavior of almost every description, ranging from the most highly specialized to some of the most primitive forms, is practiced within these four groups.",
    "One of the things Dr. Davis wants to do through his study of these families is to trace the evolutionary history of mining.",
    "Re- cently, Dr. Leo J. Hickey, a Museum paleobotanist, found a Nepticu- lid leaf mine on a lower Cretaceous Angiosperm leaf, a discovery that extends this basic ecological association between plants and insects back nearly 110 million years.",
    "Dr. Davis is now examining the Smithsonian-U.S. Geological Survey collection of Cretaceous and early Tertiary Angiosperms for further evidence of early Lepi- doptera leaf-mining injury.",
    "The mined leaves that Dr. Davis collects on trips to habitats like the Great Dismal Swamp and the Great Smoky Mountains are brought back to his Museum laboratory so that the miner larvae can be reared, identified, and closely observed.",
    "Dr. Davis plans studies of all phases of their life cycle, including oviposition, larval development, mine morphology, pupation, and adult behavior.",
    "He is also interested in correlating the systematics and behavior of the moths with that of their plant hosts.",
    "Why does a particular species of miner often only feed on a particular species of plant?",
    "But before such intriguing biological questions can be seriously studied, basic taxonomic revisions must be prepared.",
    "Much of the classification of the four families was done in the nineteenth century, an age when moth investigators described the color and venation of wings \u2014 but little else.",
    "The skeleton, which is now recognized as the best part of the insect on which to base a taxonomic diagnosis, was often ignored.",
    "Dr. Davis has had to start out by eliminating the confusion this has created.",
    "He is now assembling comprehensive illustrated texts to facilitate rapid, accurate identification for the approximately 365 presently recognized North American species and the more than 100 new species that have come to light in his studies.",
    "What will happen if the sea-level canal the U.S. Government has proposed constructing sometime in the future across the Isthmus of Panama mixes the animal and plant groups of the Atlantic and Pacific sides?",
    "Scientists say that serious ecological disruptions could follow.",
    "Dr. Meredith L. Jones, Curator of Worms in the Museum's Department of Invertebrate Zoology, saw several years ago that the lack of fundamental knowledge about the communities of marine 86 / Smithsonian Year 1974 animals that live in the shallow waters on both sides of the isthmus would make it extremely difficult to assess the nature of these dis- ruptions after they occur.",
    "Well-documented collections were needed to provide a benchmark for future investigations.",
    "To assemble these.",
    "Dr. Jones organized the Museum's Panama Biota Program.",
    "The original qualitative collecting method involved hand-picking the organisms from the surface of a sieve that had been used to process an undetermined amount of sediment.",
    "Dr. Jones and his colleagues devised a quantitative method that they are now using to get true samples of the density and diversity of invertebrate organisms living in Panama's coastal waters.",
    "Collections are made while the tide is still high.",
    "Standing in water that is anywhere from ankle to waist deep, the scientists drive a cubical stainless steel jacket, that has an area of 1/20 of a square meter, 8 inches down into the mud.",
    "Then they slide a shovel under the jacket, draw it out of the bottom, sieve the sample, and bottle all of the residue.",
    "In typical samples taken the new way, the yields comprised an average of about 1800 specimens per square meter on a clean sand beach on the Atlantic coast, about 6400 specimens per square meter on a muddy sand beach on the Pacific, and about 46,000 specimens per square meter in an Atlantic turtle-grass bed.",
    "Five samples are usually taken at each collection station in order to insure that contrasting microenvironments within a habitat are represented.",
    "An effort has also been made to take samples at each station at every season of the year.",
    "At the Museum, a technician-student has been making quantita- tive counts of invertebrate life forms in each sample, classifying the animals by families.",
    "There is such an abundance of life in each sample that processing it takes the technician six full days of work.",
    "When Dr. Jones examines the worms in a sample to identify them at a species level, six more days of work are involved.",
    "He estimates that it will take him three to four years to get through all of the samples that have been collected.",
    "If a sea-level canal should be constructed.",
    "Dr. Jones is satisfied that now scientists will be able to go back to the same site, make new collections, and then make comparisons that will show them what is happening, and enable them to predict what will happen next and if it will be beneficial or harmful.",
    "If the sea-level canal is never constructed.",
    "Dr. Jones believes the Program is still well worthwhile.",
    "Science I 87 It is accumulating collections of unique value in an area of tremen- dous biological interest.",
    "The present Panama Canal with freshwater lakes situated mid- way along its length has proved a highly effective barrier to the passage of marine life from one side of Central America to the other.",
    "So a scientist's curiosity is aroused when a marine fish native to the Pacific shows up in the Caribbean.",
    "Dr. Victor G. Springer, Curator of Fishes in the Museum's Department of Vertebrate Zoology, re- cently looked into the matter of a tropical Indo-West Pacific blenniid fish population living off Trinidad and the Atlantic entrance to the Canal.",
    "Was it a relic population that was once distributed through- out the world's tropic waters or had it been artificially introduced, conceivably through the Canal?",
    "The facts argued against its being a relic population.",
    "Members of the blenniid family speciate rapidly and no blenniid species is found in both the eastern Pacific and western Atlantic Oceans, which were last connected 2 to 4 million years ago.",
    "If the fish had once been widely distributed in the tropics, its Indo-West Pacific and Caribbean populations would have evolved into different species since the rise of the isthmus.",
    "Dr. Springer concluded that it must have been arti- ficially introduced into the western Atlantic, probably by the dis- charge of ballast or bilge waters of ships.",
    "The fish is small and found in abundance around docks where it can easily be sucked into a ship's ballast tanks.",
    "Other small marine fish have been picked up in this way, taken thousands of miles, released when the ship discharged its bilge waters, and established breeding populations.",
    "But this is the only instance of a fish being introduced in this way into the Caribbean.",
    "Did the ships that brought the fish to the Caribbean enter through the Canal?",
    "Dr. Springer thinks not.",
    "Ships coming across the Pacific discharge their bilge-ballast water before they enter the Canal; that being the case, the fish should be established on the Pacific side of the Canal.",
    "But it has never been found there or anywhere else in the eastern Pacific, but it does occur at the Atlantic entrance to the Canal.",
    "Trinidad is where the fish has its principal Caribbean popula- tion and where it was first collected in the Atlantic in 1930.",
    "Dr. Springer believes that instead of coming across the Pacific, the fish arrived in Trinidad from the Indo-West Pacific via the Atlantic before the Canal was first opened in 1914.",

    "In that period, thousands of coolies arrived on ships that traveled from India to the Caribbean around southern Africa.",
    "It is Dr. Springer's view that the coolie trade vessels were the vehicles that introduced Omobranchus punctatus into the western Atlantic.",
    "Garnet can be yellow, orange, red, lilac or purple, depending on its chemical composition and upon the temperature and pressure conditions under which it formed in the earth.",
    "It has long been known by scientists that this colorful mineral occurs in varying quantities in kimberlite pipes, the bodies of igneous rock that are the primary source of diamonds.",
    "But the fact that there was a high or low concentration of garnet in a pipe did not seem to indicate one way or the other if there was an abundance or dearth of diamonds present.",
    "Last year, however.",
    "Dr. George S. Switzer, Curator of Min- eralogy in the Museum's Department of Mineral Science, discovered that certain lilac-colored garnets have special compositional charac- teristics that make it possible to say that if they are present in a pipe, it is a diagnostic indication that diamonds are likely to be found there in economic quantities.",
    "These garnets are formed \u2014 as diamonds are \u2014 in the earth's upper mantle at a depth of 100-150 miles.",
    "When molten kimberlite forces its way to the surface at velocities estimated to be on the order of 300-400 feet per second, it sometimes brings both of these min- erals up with it from the earth's interior.",
    "The garnet is found in the pipes in rocks called xenoliths (eclogites and periodites) and some- times in diamonds as minute inclusions.",
    "Because of its occurrence in diamonds, all of the garnet was thought by some scientists to have crystallized (reached equilibrium) at the same time, place, and tem- perature as the diamonds.",
    "Another school of thought, however, held that the garnets in kimberlite xenoliths crystallized at lower temperatures than garnet inside the diamond.",
    "These two opposing views were tested by Dr. Switzer in a detailed study of the garnet in the Finsch kimberlite pipe, one of the richest diamond mines in South Africa.",
    "Finsch is also rich in garnet.",
    "It makes up 90 percent of the mineral concentrate recovered there dur- ing the diamond extraction process.",
    "Dr. Switzer brought back to the Museum a handful of garnet 90 / Smithsonian Year 1974 h\\ Dr. George S. Switzer, Curator of Mineralogy, Department of Mineral Science, using the electron microprobe.",
    "grains of all colors that had been recovered at Finsch in the extraction process.",
    "He sorted 300 of these on the basis of color into eight cate- gories and analyzed them on the Department's electron microprobe, which can identify and quantify the elements within each grain.",
    "The results showed that some of the grains of lilac-colored gar- nets \u2014 magnesum rich and calcium poor \u2014 had a chromium con- tent that placed them within the compositional field of the garnets previously only reported as inclusions in diamonds.",
    "Dr. Switzer, who is now testing garnets from other kimberlite pipes, believes that the presence of lilac-colored diamond of this special composition is diag- nostic of the presence of diamond in a pipe, but it is not known yet if there is any quantitative relationship.",

    "The acquisition of this propagation and research facility \u2014 to be known as the National Zoological Park's Research and Conservation Center \u2014 will mark the end of the long search for a country facility which could be used to breed and maintain animal herds in sufficient numbers to insure their continuation as a viable, social, and genetic group.",
    "The educational mission of the National Zoological Park located in the valley of Rock Creek in Washington precludes the use of vast amounts of land for a single species so that it is not able to maintain ongoing herds of animals with proper age-pyramid and genetic mixture.",
    "Considering the worldwide shrinking of land areas available to wild animals, the increased hazards of disease, poach- ing, and land degradation by humans, the plight of many animals is indeed precarious.",
    "It is hoped that by establishing herds of threat- ened and endangered species at the Research and Conservation Cen- ter, in some cases through collaboration with other zoos in the United States, the Zoo will have a steady and reliable source of animals as well as a source for continuing zoological research on behalf of these species.",
    "The development of the Research and Conservation Center will be deliberately paced, and future reports will carry information con- cerning its advancement.",

    "The white-cheeked gibbon family produced a fine offspring to the delight of the staff and the visitors; and for the first time at the National Zoological Park, the binturongs produced young, which are being closely studied both for their growth and development as well as their behavioral relationship with the mother.",

    "Other outstanding hatchings include three Stanley's Cranes, ten Rheas, and three American Mergansers.",
    "Among the reptiles, the most notable breeding was of the Bur- mese pythons in which three clutches were laid and 45 young snakes were hatched.",
    "This program was of great scientific interest as incu- bation of the eggs was carried out both artificially and naturally.",
    "In the latter case the females coiled around the egg masses, maintaining the proper body heat by rhythmic muscle twitchings.",
    "This process was of great interest to the visitors and particularly so since electrical sensors were connected to recording thermometers to trace tempera- ture fluctuations.",
    "The breeding program at the National Zoological Park is pro- gressing quite well, space permitting, and the efforts of the scientific research department's behavioral studies, the contributions from the animal health department on nutrition, preventive medicine, as well as the diligent endeavors of the animal management department are 100 / Smithsonian Year 1974 Burmese pythons.",

    "He was a great delight to the visitors, being an excellent talker.",
    "He soon learned English, and one of his favorite phrases, \"open the door, Richard,\" gradually brought about his change in name by which in later years he was known.",
    "This bird was thoroughly imprinted on human beings and would have nothing to do with his feathered kin, preferring the company of humans; for this reason since 1965 he was exhibited in the Ele- phant House to the delight of thousands of children if not to the delight of the hippopotamuses, his nearest neighbors.",
    "His maniacal laughter, joyous whistling, and general rowdiness will be missed.",
    "He has been replaced by an Amazon parrot, who was given to the Zoo as a pet similarly imprinted.",

    "For example, efforts in 1974 show that the success of second-genera- tion breeding in the golden marmoset hinges upon an understanding of the formation of social bonds and the role of early experience in the participation of rearing young.",
    "Through analysis, such as are currently being carried on in the Zoo and in parallel in the field, an understanding and interpretation of communication in, for example, the spider monkey now becomes possible.",

    "Radiation Biology Laboratory The importance and significance of energy as the driving force of our technological society became abundantly clear in 1974 as politi- cal and economic forces displaced familiar use patterns.",
    "Thus, the laboratory's charter \"to study the role of sunlight in maintaining life on the earth\" anticipated current concerns by almost a half cen- tury.",
    "In fact, the purposes and objectives of the laboratory become increasingly important as the world's population grows, and its food needs and requirements for diminishing fossil-fuel resources expand.",
    "During fiscal 1974 the laboratory emphasized several major areas of research on aspects of solar radiation that influence biological systems: (1) measuring the solar energy received at the earth's sur- face, its quantity, quality, and duration, since these parameters establish the starting point for all aspects of photobiology; (2) the biochemistry and biophysics of energy storage (photosynthesis) and the structures (pigments and membrane systems) involved in cap- 112 / Smithsonian Year 1974 turing the sun's energy; (3) the regulation of the use of this stored energy by Hving organisms in response to complex signals of light, temperature, or gases in the environment; and (4) the use of the photosynthetic products to date the time when objects of biological origin were last alive and in equilibrium with the environment (carbon dating).",
    "SOLAR ENERGY Measurements of solar energy were recorded from a monitoring network including four locations: Barrow, Alaska; Flamenco Island, Panama; the National Physical Laboratory in Jerusalem, Israel; and at Rockville, Maryland.",
    "This network covers the Northern Hemi- sphere reasonably well and records at three-minute intervals the energy received in six color bands, as well as the total energy from the ultraviolet short wavelength limit to the infrared (2.8 microns), where the energy per photon is no longer capable of driving photo- chemical reactions.",
    "From this enormous volume of data have been extracted many useful pieces of information.",
    "For example, the area required for suitable collectors to provide the necessary energy to heat or to air condition buildings may be 'calculated or estimates of the upper limits for plant growth in an area may be computed.",
    "In addition, some data implicate solar ultraviolet with skin cancer incidence.",
    "Particularly, as more and more supersonic transport air- craft are flown, it is postulated that the fuel exhausts will catalyze the breakdown of the protective ozone screen in the atmosphere, which limits the amount of ultraviolet penetrating to the earth's surface.",
    "In cooperation with the Air Resources Laboratories of NOAA, a scanning radiometer was stationed at Tallahassee, Florida.",
    "This instrument measures narrow bandwidths of ultraviolet in the erythemal (region of sunlight that causes skin reddening) band and these data are being tested to see if a correlation exists between quality and quantity received and the incidence of skin cancer (as measured by the National Cancer Institute) in Tallahassee, Another important factor in solar irradiance measurements is the primary standard to which all measurements are referred.",
    "The Smithsonian has a long history of developing standards, and this year a symposium was held for international authorities on solar instruments and measurements to discuss and evaluate the initiation Science 1 113 Spectral radiation monitoring by the Radiation Biology Laboratory at the Pacific entrance of the Panama Canal.",
    "The units shown are pyranometers mounted on the roof of the monitoring site.",
    "and worldwide use of a uniform and precisely defined measuring scale.",
    "While there is, as yet, no consensus as to the best scale system, at least intercomparison may now be made in a more rational man- ner.",
    "The papers presented at this symposium will be published as a Smithsonian publication.",
    "In order to pursue the importance of light on plant growth, four large growth chambers were installed in which the major parameters regulating plant growth can be controlled.",

    "Plants are grown on soil or artificial substrate systems (nutriculture).",
    "REGULATORY BIOLOGY Light in the environment also may regulate the rate of synthesis of cell components or the rate of metabolism and growth of plant parts.",
    "Such light signals must be absorbed by pigment molecules to be effective.",

    "peptides produced, information has been obtained about the mole- cular weight and the chemical structure of this protein pigment.",
    "The phytochrome pigment was isolated from dark-grown rye seed- lings.",
    "After purification, electrophoresis, and gel permeation chroma- tography of the undenatured protein indicated a molecular weight of about 400,000 daltons.",
    "Disc gel electrophoresis in detergents indicated a principal product was formed with a molecular weight of about 120,000 daltons.",
    "Cleavage of the protein was performed with cyanogen bromide, which reacts with methionine residues.",
    "This produced five peptides: one of 15,000 daltons, a chromopeptide containing the light-absorbing portion (11,000 daltons), one about 8000 daltons, and two smaller ones.",
    "These data are consistent with the 13S phytochrome being composed of one species of protomer having a molecular weight of 42,000 and 4 methionine residues per protomer.",
    "Another approach to the molecular function of phytochrome is the determination of the dependence of physiological responses upon the dose of light given.",
    "For a number of flowering plants, such as peas and mustard, dose-response curves were determined, as well as changes in the dose-response curves following sequential expo- sures to light.",
    "In addition, the capacity for rapid chlorphyll accumu- lation was measured.",
    "Data indicate that the physiologically active form of phytochrome produced by the first red exposure migrates to a membrane surface, which results in more light being required for a given response.",
    "But once light is absorbed, it is more effective because the active molecule is already attached to a membrane in- volved in the response.",
    "For photosynthesis to occur efficiently, the incident sunlight must be absorbed in all wavelength regions.",
    "Algae have solved this prob- lem by forming special pigment protein complexes known as phyco- bilisomes.",
    "These complexes trap the light energy and transfer it to a \"reaction center,\" where it is used to produce energy-rich com- pounds.",
    "Phycobilisomes can be isolated and then dissociated into their component parts.",
    "A model has been developed this year that describes at the molecular level the spatial arrangement of at least four pigments involved and their attachment to the photosynthetic membranes.",
    "The chloroplasts of higher plants also trap light energy and convert it to chemical energy.",
    "Formation of chloroplasts and the 116 / Smithsonian Year 1974 maintenance of chloroplast structure is a fascinating problem that is attracting considerable attention.",
    "Making the proteins for a func- tional chloroplast requires cooperation between nuclear and chloro- plast genetic systems.",
    "That is, the genetic material for and the synthesis of certain chloroplast proteins are located in the nucleus and cytoplasm respectively, while the genetic material for and the synthesis of other chloroplast proteins are located in the chloroplast.",
    "Part of the chloroplast protein synthesis occurs on chloroplast photosynthetic membranes.",
    "During the past year, a system was developed in which biosyn- thesis of chloroplast photosynthetic membranes could be studied in vitro.",
    "In actively growing cells of the alga Chlamydomonas, a large portion of chloroplast ribosomes exists attached to the photosyn- thetic membranes.",
    "Electron micrographs of isolated membranes show that some of the ribosomes are bound as polyribosomes.",
    "When the membranes are dissolved by detergent, these polyribosomes can be recovered and account for more than half of the ribosomes bound to the membranes.",
    "These results suggest that the membrane-ribosome association functions in protein synthesis, because polysomes occur when active protein synthesis takes place.",
    "This assumption was confirmed by the finding that the isolated membrane-ribosome association will carry out protein synthesis.",
    "This protein synthesis reaction depends on the presence of the ribosomes attached to the membranes.",
    "It is inhibited by chloramphenicol, not by cyclohexi- mide, as is expected for protein synthesis by chloroplast ribosomes.",
    "The protein synthesis reaction requires an energy generation system and a soluble cell extract.",
    "The reaction is inhibited by ribonuclease.",
    "These properties indicate that the protein synthesis reaction is car- ried out by the isolated membranes.",
    "Blue light regulates the biosynthesis of yellow pigments, such as the vitamin A precursor, ^-carotene.",
    "At least eight different caro- tenoids are synthesized after light exposure of dark-grown mycelial pads of the bread mold Neurospora crassa.",
    "The photoinduction of these pigments can be divided into at least three phases : (a) a rapid light reaction, (b) a period of protein synthesis, and (c) accumulation of the carotenoid pigment.",
    "The effect of temperature on these processes has been studied this year.",
    "The light reaction, of course, is temperature-independent, but synthesis immediately following light exposure has an optimum Science 1 117 near 6\u00b0C.",
    "These data, as well as studies with inhibitors of protein synthesis, indicate that the light reaction produces an inducer that activates a gene.",
    "The genetic code in the activated gene specifies the amino-acid sequence of an enzyme required for carotenoid biosyn- thesis.",
    "This enzyme is apparently absent in dark-grown cultures.",
    "Furthermore, physiological evidence indicates that the inducer is lost from the carotenoid-synthesizing system in a temperature- dependent competitive reaction.",
    "In addition, four different types of mutant strains of Neurospora were produced from wild type by uv light: albinos, which do not make pigment even in the presence of light; yellow-orange mutants, which synthesize a different distribution of pigments; mutants in which the sensitivity of carotenoid synthesis to temperatures above 6\u00b0C has been reduced; and mutants which can make pigment in the dark.",
    "The activities of many enzymes in organisms from bacteria to man appear to be under the control of cyclic-AMP (adenosine mono- phosphate).",
    "For example, in man the hormones epinephrine or glu- cagon stimulate the synthesis of cyclic-AMP, which in turn activates a series of enzymes required for starch breakdown.",
    "Evidence has been obtained that animal cells that have been transformed by a virus to cancerous cells have lower than normal cyclic-AMP levels.",
    "There is evidence in frogs and rats that light controls the level of cyclic-AMP.",
    "We have obtained evidence that such a control system exists in Neurospora and may be part of the mechanism for photo- induction of carotenoid synthesis.",
    "Since cyclic-AMP probably regu- lates the activities of many different enzymes in Neurospora, then control of the level of cyclic-AMP by light should regulate a number of biochemical pathways besides carotenoid synthesis.",
    "Such a control mechanism can be conveniently studied in Neurospora and the results used to predict the type of control system that operates in higher organisms.",
    "ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY Light acts not only as a carrier of information for regulating metabo- lism but is also absorbed and stored as chemical energy, along with the production of oxygen as a byproduct (photosynthesis).",
    "If leaves of plants are exposed to low temperatures (chilling), there is an inhibition in the rate of fixation of carbon dioxide.",
    "In addition, the 118 / Smithsonian Year 1974 oxygen-evolving power of leaves after cold storage is regulated by mangano-protein in the chloroplast thylakoids.",
    "Since a great deal of the world's agriculture and the distribution of wild plant populations are limited by temperature, it is important to determine the portion of the photosynthetic mechanism directly affected by chilling.",
    "Plants that were grown under very warm conditions (30 \u00b0C) were exposed to a succession of days and nights of cool (10\u00b0C day, S^C night) temperatures, and the ability of whole leaves to take up carbon dioxide was measured.",
    "Within 24 hours after exposure to low temperature, the plants' capacity to take up carbon dioxide at warm temperatures was reduced by about 25 percent.",
    "Longer expo- sure to low temperature brings with it further reduction in carbon assimilation.",
    "The process of photosynthesis involves considerably more than carbon dioxide assimilation, and in order to determine which of the many steps is affected by changes in temperature, a partitioning of the process was attempted.",
    "Photosynthetic cells from the leaf were separated from the remaining nonphotosynthetic tissue.",
    "Active whole cells were obtained which retain the capacity to evolve oxygen using light.",
    "Exposure of plants to chilling temperatures, however, does not consistently affect the capacity of cells extracted from these plants to evolve oxygen.",
    "Sometimes there is a substantial reduction in oxygen evolution and sometimes only minor change.",
    "The reason for this variability is as yet unknown.",
    "Measurements have been made of the total productive capacity for communities of plants in a salt marsh in the Chesapeake Bay.",
    "It has been assumed that salt marshes contribute substantially to their neighboring estuaries and are consequently essential to the maintenance of life in the estuaries.",
    "Assimilated carbon in the marsh is exported to the estuary; however, most data for this assumption are based upon an incomplete examination of the capacity of the marsh to take up and metabolize carbon!",
    "A plastic chamber to enclose a section of the marsh community has been constructed in conjunction with a continuous flow, infrared, gas-analysis system to monitor the net carbon dioxide exchange over the marsh com- munity.",
    "In addition to net carbon dioxide exchange, a method has been evaluated for determining the amount of green matter in a marsh without the necessity of destroying any of the community being Science 1 119 f 0- ,^,f Plastic chamber for measuring net carbon dioxide exchange over a marsh community on an estuary of the Chesapeake Bay.",
    "Carbon dioxide concentra- tion is determined in air as it enters and leaves the chamber.",
    "Below: Radio- meter device for measuring reflectance of red and far-red light from a marsh community.",
    "Reflectance measurements are used in estimating the standing crop biomass.",
    "/^X^i\u00bb*iE^J\"\u00bb' ;r \u25a0** studied.",
    "The method depends upon the fact that green plants reflect red light less than they reflect far-red radiation (light that is at and just beyond the sensitivity of the human eye).",
    "The seasonal change in reflectance of these two bands of light was found to change as the total amount of green matter in the stand of plants changed.",
    "This method was originally developed to study productivity of prairie communities, but the method appears to work in marshes.",
    "A correlation was found between the reflectance measurements and direct measurements of biomass obtained by cutting and weighing samples.",
    "Thus, a rapid, nondestructive assay of growth in marshes can be obtained.",
    "The method also has the advantage that the equip- ment is portable and, thus, usable in remote locations.",
    "The growth of plants in an estuarine environment is sometimes limited by phosphorus cycling in the tidal environment.",
    "Phosphorus flux rates and phosphorus cycling in situ in the tidal marsh, mud flat periphyton, and plankton communities of the Rhode River sub- estuary of Chesapeake Bay were measured.",

    "From these data the major pathways of phosphorus cycling in estuarine plankton were constructed.",
    "The heavy arrows are believed to be main pathways.",
    "Microbiological data, as well as the size classing and inhibitor data, support this picture.",
    "Thus, orthophosphate is taken up mostly by bacteria that are mainly on the surfaces of suspended sediments and detritus, but phytoplankton also take up some orthophosphate in the light.",
    "The bacteria and phytoplankton are then eaten by filter feeders, especially ciliate protozoans.",
    "These in turn release most of the phosphorus as dis- solved orthophosphate and organic phosphorus.",
    "In addition, the phosphorus cycling in a deciduous forest when subjected to various levels of mineral nutrient loading was measured.",
    "Phosphorus loading of the leaf-litter zone beneath beech trees in Maryland was varied from the \"natural\" level (3 to 12 mg P.m~^* day~^) to 430 mg P.m~^*day~^ above the natural level.",
    "Phosphorus- 32 was used to measure rates and to determine pathways of phos- phorus cycling.",
    "Upon increased loading, the phosphorus content of \\ the litter increased fourfold and then stabilized.",
    "When this loading was discontinued, the phosphorus content of the litter declined to the original level.",
    "Phosphorus not assimilated by the leaf litter moved rapidly through the soil both vertically and horizontally.",
    "Forest trees obtained most of their phosphorus from the litter zone.",
    "Sometimes the effects of a sudden dramatic changes in energy flow in the environment can be assayed.",
    "Such a dynamic stress occurred in tropical storm Agnes.",
    "Although the storm center cir- cumnavigated the Rhode River estuary, the salinity reached a minimum about two weeks later because of flooding by the Susque- hanna River.",
    "This event was coincident with the year's highest water temperature (30-31 \u00b0C) and resulted in severe mortalities in the ' biota.",
    "Periphyton (attached microbial communities) experienced a nearly complete die-off.",
    "High levels of sediments and of nutrients, especially nitrate and total- phosphorus, were delivered to Rhode River by the bay proper and from local runoff.",
    "These nutrients were deposited in Rhode River bottom sediments.",
    "This reservoir released nutrients a year later, especially at a time of low dissolved 122 / Smithsonian Year 1974 oxygen in the bottom water and of intensive dinoflagellate blooms.",
    "In a 13-day period it is estimated that over 900 Kg phosphorus was released from the bottom sediments.",
    "Thus, even though the effects were indirect from tropical storm Agnes, they were large.",
    "CARBON DATING Because all living things are in equilibrium with the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and this equilibrium is fixed at the time of death, with the radioactive carbon^'* gradually decaying away as the sample ages, it is possible to determine the age of biological specimens back to about 40,000 years by measuring their radioactive carbon^'* con- tent.",
    "From data taken from the remains and artifacts of archaic populations, it is possible to explore the relationships between changing environments and changing cultures.",
    "I From such artifacts a chronological framework is being con- structed for populations in North America.",
    "In cooperation with anthropologists, geologists, and palynologists the time period 6000 B.c to 2000 B.C. has been examined for northeastern North America.",
    "f Of particular interest is the date of entry of man into the New World.",
    "In cooperation with the University of Alaska, dating of \u25a0selected archeological and geological sites discovered during con- } struction of the Alaska pipeline have been accomplished.",
    "Recent [findings published by the Scripps Institution, using the determina- I tion of racemic mixtures of aspartic acid, indicate that man was i present in North America at least 50,000 years before the present. [",
    "However, dates from the North Slope in our laboratory confirm ' occupation of more than 10,000 years ago.",
    "Thus, the requirement for more energy to drive our technology that resulted in the need for the Alaska pipeline has yielded as a secondary scientific benefit an indication of man's early history in the New World.",
    "PUBLIC SERVICE Lectures and invited symposium talks were presented by the staff to more than 30 research institutions and universities, both nation- ally and internationally.",

    "| The creation of this new consolidated science program, drawing \u2022 on the resources of the Smithsonian Institution and Harvard Univer- sity to achieve scientific excellence, is both a response to the new research goals and opportunities of the present and a reflection of traditional ties of the past.",
    "During the past decade, astrophysics has experienced an explosion of ideas.",
    "New windows on the universe have been opened by the discovery of radiation in unexpected bands of the electromagnetic spectrum.",
    "And the expanded use of rocket, balloon, and satellite experiments has allowed observation of this radiation from above the earth's obscuring atmosphere.",
    "Gamma rays.",
    "X-rays, ultraviolet light, and infrared radiation are all now observed almost as routinely as radio and visible waves.",
    "Each new spectrum window has revealed a vast and varied universe filled with objects defying the imagina- tion: quasars, pulsars.",
    "X-ray and gamma-ray stars, black holes, and neutron stars, as well as massive interstellar clouds of dust particles and complex molecules.",
    "When it was founded by Samuel Pierpont Langley in 1890, the goal of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory was the increase and diffusion of knowledge about the earth and its immediate as- tronomical environment.",
    "This goal remains unchanged today; how- ever, the technological developments in observational techniques and data analysis, coupled with unusual advances in theoretical astronomy, now allow Smithsonian scientists to expand their astronomical horizons to the very edge of the universe.",
    "Two major scientific problems are at the core of this expanded astronomical research program.",
    "The first is the evolution of matter, starting with the explosive beginning of the universe some 20 billion 124 / Smithsonian Year 1974 I years ago.",
    "After the formation of galaxies and stars, some matter collapsed into those exotic and unusual objects known as quasars, neutron stars, and black holes.",
    "i The extreme physical conditions existing in these objects severely test all the fundamental principles of modern physics.",
    "Obviously, the evolutionary processes forming stars and galaxies hold clues to how the universe began \u2014 and how it may end!",
    "The second problem concerns the cosmic matter that has cooled sufficiently for molecules and solid particles to form.",
    "The conden- sation of materials accompanying the formation of stars like our own sun apparently results in the formation of planets and the eventual emergence of life.",
    "Through continued studies of this matter in space, as well as of the sun, planets, and earth, sao scientists seek to understand the processes that led to the origin of life in the universe.",
    "The solution of these two problems in modern astronomy can be achieved only through the concerted efforts of a variety of investi- gators using a diversity of approaches.",
    "For example, the study of matter under extreme conditions can be approached through high- energy astrophysics, solar and stellar physics, or optical astronomy; while the study of solid particles can be approached through infra- red and radio astronomy, planetary sciences or geoastronomy.",
    "Theoretical and laboratory studies underlie each approach.",
    "Each approach also requires quite different research tools, ranging from rocket, balloon, and satellite detectors for gamma-ray and X-ray astronomy, to shock-tube and radiation laboratories and computers for molecular and atomic physics.",
    "The complexity of modern astronomical research thus demands the consolidation of efforts whenever possible.",
    "The Center for Astrophysics is designed for this purpose \u2014 to draw on the differ- ent strengths of the Smithsonian and Harvard observatories.",
    "The once loose groupings of scientists and projects are now concentrated in eight divisions representing the major approaches to the dual problems of cosmic evolution and life in the universe.",

    "Specifically, this group is concerned with the chemical re- Science / 125 actions occurring in planetary atmospheres and interstellar clouds Major efforts include the development of model potential methods ;| in theoretical atomic physics, the calculation of atomic transition probabilities, and the application of laser techniques to atomic and molecular spectroscopy.",
    "The measurements resulting from the spectroscopic research will play a critical role in the interpretation of data returned from other Center space programs.",
    "CEOASTRONOMY This division continues sao's long-term program to study earth dynamics, the upper atmosphere, and earth's gravitational field.",
    "In cooperation with scores of other organizations around the world, the earth dynamics program is building the large data base necessary to define the kinematics, bulk dynamics, and mass distri- bution of the earth.",
    "The program depends heavily on sao's sophisti- cated laser and camera satellite-tracking network, supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.",
    "The upper atmospheric research program uses computer analysis of the anomalies in satellite orbits to develop accurate models of the earth's gravity field and to define the forces exerted by both sunshine and earthshine.",
    "A gravitational redshift project will utilize an extremely accurate, rocket-borne, maser clock, paired with a similar ground-based instrument, to test the equivalence principle of Einstein's Theory of Relativity in the gravitational field of the earth.",
    "HIGH-ENERGY ASTROPHYSICS The Center is emerging as a national leader in the field of high- energy astronomy, and particularly X-ray research, through its participation in the NASA-sponsored series of high-energy astronomi- cal observatories (head).",
    "Major efforts are directed toward con- struction and planning of experiments aboard the heao-b, now scheduled for launch in 1975 as the first true space observatory capable of high angular resolution X-ray observations.",
    "This satellite will permit the first studies of the X-ray structure of extended objects and complex sources.",
    "In the meantime, the division continues its analysis of data obtained by-UHURU satellite, the pioneering experi- ment in this field.",
    "This effort has led to the first identification of a probable \"black hole\" in the constellation Cygnus.",
    "126 / Smithsonian Year 1974 Ground-based observations at Mt. Hopkins have led to the detec- tion of gamma-ray emissions from the Crab Nebula.",
    "I OPTICAL AND INFRARED ASTRONOMY This division's activities fall in four related areas : studies of infrared emissions from galaxies and H II regions; studies of the spectra of stars and circumstellar materials; analysis of the spectra of inter- stellar materials and planetary atmospheres; and optical studies of emission from X-ray sources and pulsars.",
    "Observations are made with Center instruments at Mt. Hopkins, Arizona; Agassiz Station, Massachusetts; and Boy den Station, South Africa; as well as with instruments at the Kitt Peak National Observatory, Arizona, and the Hale Observatories, California, and their respective Southern Hemisphere installations at Cerro Tololo and Las Campanas, Chile.",
    "The Harvard component of these observing programs is supported by the National Science Foundation (nsf).",
    "This division's observational capabilities will be greatly enhanced by the addition of a large telescope of revolutionary design.",
    "This multiple-mirror telescope (mmt) combines six 72-inch mirrors in a hexagonal array around a central core to produce an instrument with the light-gathering capacity of a conventional 176-inch telescope.",
    "The MMT is now under construction jointly by sao and the University of Arizona.",
    "PLANETARY SCIENCES Traditionally, sao has been a recognized leader in the study of the smaller bodies of the solar system.",
    "Vigorous programs involving geochemical and petrological analyses of lunar and meteoritical samples continue, as does the remote sensing of planets, satellites, and asteroids, largely supported by nasa.",
    "Observations of comets, combined with computer analyses of their orbits and laboratory studies of their physical properties, also continue.",
    "During the past year, the Center served as a major clearing- house for information related to the international program to observe and study Comet Kohoutek.",

    "The extensive data produced by the Harvard experiment aboard nasa's Skylab satellite should provide the basis for several years of analysis and interpretation leading to a new understanding of the energy-generation processes in the outer layers of the sun.",
    "The broad range of SAO-developed computer programs and theoretical techniques is being applied to the interpretation of ultraviolet solar and stellar observations, both from Skylab and other satellites such as Copernicus.",
    "In addition, the successful flight of a balloon-mounted 40-inch infrared telescope in early 1974 demonstrated the feasibility of further large-aperture flights for broadband photometry and mapping, multiband and galactic sources.",
    "This project was a joint venture of sao, hco, and the University of Arizona.",
    "THEORETICAL ASTROPHYSICS If the Center is distinguished by its broad spectrum of astrophysical problems under investigation, then it is the theoretical effort that serves as the catalyst encouraging active and fruitful interrelation- ships among different approaches to similar problems.",
    "Thus, the objectives of this division are to establish and maintain expertise in those areas of physics underlying the applications to astrophysics, to create active research areas along a broad front, and to alert the Center staff of new directions in astrophysics.",
    "Most important, perhaps, this division plays a major role in the Center's commitment to astronomy education: identifying, encouraging, and training new 128 / Smithsonian Year 1974 iastronomers, as well as bringing talented students and younger pro- fessionals into its research program.",
    "Much of this division's effort is also supported by nsf.",
    "The pooling of Smithsonian and Harvard scientific resources in a Center for Astrophysics seems an appropriately modern and rational adaptation to the times.",
    "Oddly enough, it is more the natural evolution of the long relationship between the two organizations.",
    "Since 1955, when the headquarters of sao moved to the grounds of the Harvard College Observatory in Cambridge, the two observa- tories have pursued astronomical research in close collaboration, with many members of the Smithsonian staff holding joint appoint- ments at Harvard and using University-owned facilities.",
    "The ties between Harvard and Smithsonian, however, reach back into the nineteenth century, when Harvard alumnus and United States President John Quincy Adams urged both his alma mater and his Congress to establish jointly an astronomical observatory to serve the nation, preferably under the aegis of the Smithsonian Institution.",
    "Echoing this call for joint academic-government action, Joseph Henry, first Secretary of the Institution, later urged that any observ- atory established by the Smithsonian should be \"closely connected with some well-endowed and well-established college or university.\"",
    "Nearly a century and a half have passed, but the dreams of both Joseph Henry and John Quincy Adams are finally realized in the Center for Astrophysics.",
    "This cooperative venture has great impli- cations for the future, not only because it may serve as a guide for other similar pairings of private and public institutions, but also because the basic goals it pursues must surely affect all aspects of human life \u2014 from genetics to energy production.",
    "Smithsonian Science Information Exchange, Inc. This year has been an important one for the Smithsonian Science Information Exchange (ssie) as it actively began its efforts to move from a national center for information about ongoing research to one more international in terms of coverage and use of its services.",

    "These are at least seven data bases of ongoing research currently in exist- ence in other countries and many others are being developed.",
    "Input or exchange from these as well as selected input in specialized areas of interest from other countries will enhance the value of the Exchange's data base to both scientists and research managers in the United States.",
    "Many of the systems currently in existence are based on systems that were developed along the lines of the Exchange's system following visits to the ssie.",
    "Compatibility between systems will be encouraged wherever possible to facilitate exchange of information.",
    "As a consequence of its efforts in the fiscal year 1974, the Ex- change has increased foreign input and established methods for increased use of the Exchange by foreign scientists.",
    "To illustrate the latter, an agreement has been reached with the Institute for Documentation in the Federal Republic of Germany which will provide support for the use of ssie services by a large number of German scientists over an initial one-year period.",
    "The project will provide an opportunity for.",
    "a large number of German research investigators to observe firsthand the value of learning before publi- cation what their colleagues in the United States are doing in areas 130 / Smithsonian Year 1974 of research closely paralleling their own efforts.",
    "It may also expedite development of similar systems such as ssie in Germany as well as lead to more cooperative efforts on problems of similar interest and an exchange of ongoing research information.",
    "The Exchange has continued to explore and implement techniques for increased utilization of its information by coupling it with biblio- graphic information including both scientific journal literature and technical reports.",
    "These efforts include the use of publications con- taining the combined information as well as coupling of information obtained directly from the ssie data base with that from other information systems, thus providing users of such material with the latest in both published and ongoing research information.",
    "Discus- sions have taken place with several Federal data-base systems to expand this approach and offer remote on-line searches of selected portions of the Exchange's data base.",
    "Considerable progress has been made in the development and testing of a new machine-aided indexing system.",
    "This system, which was designed to help the Exchange's staff of professional scientists and engineers cope with the increasing volume of information com- ing into the Exchange, will also be of interest and value to other information systems of a similar nature.",
    "The system is not intended to replace the scientific expertise necessary for maintaining a high quality of indexing but rather complements it by picking up routine terms that are readily identifiable, freeing the scientists to concen- trate on the more important aspect of conceptual indexing.",
    "Publica- tion of the technique will be made following more extensive testing of the system in the coming year.",
    "This project is another example of the Exchange's continuing effort in research and development designed not only to improve the ssie's system but make such developments available by publication for use throughout the infor- mation community.",
    "The Exchange as a result of offering new services and expanding previously available ones has shown an increase in use in fiscal 1974 primarily as a result of making more scientists aware of the Ex- change's services.",

    "During Dr. Moynihan's tenure the permanent professional staff increased from 1 to 15, and the geographic scope of their investigations extended from Barro Colorado Island and the surrounding forests to adjacent areas of Central and South America, and then to intertropical comparisons in Gabon, Ceylon, India, Madagascar, Malaya, and New Guinea.",
    "Moynihan supported a program of student fellowship at both the pre- and post-doctoral level and encouraged a steadily increasing number of scientific visitors from around the world.",
    "The research of the institute's staff closely reflects the depth and diversity of Dr. Moynihan's own scientific interests, which in the last 15 years have ranged from the behavior, evolution, and ecology of such diverse groups as birds, primates, and cephalopods.",

    "Smithsonian Year '1974 HISTORY AND ART In singling out a few particularly noteworthy events of the past year one runs the risk of paying too little attention to the continu- ing, quiet achievements that in the long run are perhaps more im- portant.",
    "The temptation to stress dramatic change at the expense of often undramatic continuity is familiar to every historian, and to every writer of annual reports.",
    "Before succumbing to the temptation, then, we should at least begin by saying that the past year was marked by steady growth and consolidation within each of the Institution's history and art bureaus, and by encouraging signs of continuing cooperation among them.",
    "Without exception, collections were improved both by acqui- sition and by conservation; control over collections was strength- ened by better cataloguing and storage techniques; new exhibitions were mounted with satisfying regularity; research and publication continued in the best Smithsonian tradition; and programs of public education made our collections and our research more accessible to thousands of children and adults.",

    "The closing months of the past year also saw the accomplishment of a major part of what must surely be the largest shipment of art in the history of this country.",

    "The geographical scope of the Smithsonian was expanded during the past year by the opening of the West Coast regional center of the Archives of American Art.",
    "These centers, which now exist in Detroit, New York, Boston, and San Francisco serve both as regional research centers in which scholars may have access on microfilm to the entire holdings of the Archives, and as the foci of the Archives national collecting program.",
    "Often housed in contributed space \u2014 we are indebted to the DeYoung Museum for the new center \u2014 and staffed by only two or three people, these centers have an extraordi- narily positive effect on the study of the history of American art in their regions.",

    "In short, then, the past year has been one of steady growth punc- tuated by occasional, dramatic leaps forward.",
    "Between milestones \u2014 such as the fiftieth anniversary of the Freer Gallery last year, the opening of the Hirshhorn Museum next year, and the expected open- ing of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum the year after \u2014 the real progress takes place.",
    "Finally, we must sorrowfully record the death during the past year 144 / Smithsonian Year 1974 of Mrs. Marjorie Merriweather Post, one of the Institution's greatest benefactors, and of Miss Elisabeth Houghton, a beloved and valued member of the Board of Trustees of the Hirshhorn Museum.",

    "One of the most interesting phases of the work that has spread excitement throughout the entire staff has been that concerned with the stripping of layers of decorative paint and the detective work necessary to repaint and decorate the finished items.",
    "An example is the Linde-Wolk steam engine recently acquired by the Institution from the American Brewery in Baltimore, Maryland.",
    "When the Tech- nical Laboratory personnel commenced their routine documentation of the colors and designs applied to the engine over the years \u2014 stripping away each successive coat of paint, taking record photo- graphs, and tracing the decorative patterns \u2014 they discovered among its dozen discrete layers of paint an intricate panorama of delicately shaded flowers and exquisite filigrees.",
    "While the notion of such painstaking art work on a huge industrial engine may now seem anomalous, in an earlier era it clearly was considered a proper ad- junct.",
    "When completed, the engine will be repainted and decorated as it was many years ago.",
    "To assist with the unprecedented workload imposed by the res- toration program for \"1876,\" six additions were made to the crew; each new man boasts some specialized aptitude or skill essential to the successful consummation of the program.",

    "The foremost objective of the programs is to provide the framework within which each visiting student and investigator can confront individually the opportunities for the pursuit of knowledge represented in the Smithsonian's collections and its research and technical staff.",
    "In the arts, humani- ties, and sciences, students at all postsecondary levels study under the guidance of the Smithsonian's professional research faculty.",
    "Predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows undertake research train- ing in their specialties, bringing in their inquiries great intellectual stimulation and adding immeasurably to the vitality of the research climate.",
    "Predoctoral fellows generally consult Smithsonian re- sources necessary to their dissertations but not available at their universities.",
    "Postdoctoral fellows, usually recent recipients of the doctorate, seek advanced research training and the opportunity to expand studies begun at the university.",
    "During the academic year 1973-1974, 21 predoctoral and 24 postdoctoral fellowships were awarded to support these activities in most of the museums, labora- tories, and field stations of the Institution.",
    "Five students, in an earlier stage of graduate study than the predoctoral fellows, have received fellowships supported jointly by their home universities and the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum to study aspects of the social and technological impact of space exploration.",
    "Although pursuing degrees in different disciplines at different Washington-area universities, the students worked with each other as well as their Smithsonian advisor in the development of their individual projects.",
    "Fellowship appointments for directed research are provided for two to three months to graduate and undergraduate students, to offer them new perspectives on the purposes of research and to provide them access to sources and materials not encountered by them in their university-based studies.",
    "Some students pursue in- terests previously developed, but many explore areas of knowledge wholly new.",
    "For example, a summer spent at the Smithsonian might allow a first-year graduate student to reflect on the full range of alternatives in his chosen field of knowledge, and to de- History and Art 1 191 fine his future graduate course of study based on a better under- standing of what he finds both practical and interesting.",
    "During 1973-1974 such awards were made to 21 graduate and under- graduate students; 4 of the undergraduates were supported under a grant from the National Science Foundation.",
    "Other students, often undergraduates, by preference undertake studies at the Smithsonian which provide broader exposure than research training.",
    "They are participants in a program for museum study, a program offering them a chance to learn in the working museum or laboratory or field environment rather than the tradi- tional classroom atmosphere, to take part in the ongoing work, of the Institution while pursuing a project that interests and I challenges them.",
    "Most students in the program are awarded aca- demic credit by their home universities, where the student's per- formance meets the educational standards set by the Smithsonian and the standards and requirements imposed by the university.",
    "During the past year, 13 participated in museum-study projects under the close supervision of Smithsonian staff members.",

    "Yet, many of these functions take place away from public view, with the attendant consequence that they are often funded with inadequate resources or carried out in inadequate spaces.",
    "This has intermittently occurred at the Smithsonian.",
    "The enormous growth of activities which has developed in the last decade, the acquisition of new collections, the founding and construction of new museums as well as new fields of research which have opened could well have justified, in the eyes of some, a slackening of efforts and a shifting of resources to some immediately more glamorous result.",
    "It is a measure of the historical commitment of the Institu- tion to the search of excellence that this has not been the case.",
    "The last few years have seen increased emphasis given to de- veloping the infrastructure in the fields of conservation, libraries, archives, and more recently in registration.",
    "In these key areas major progress was made in fiscal year 1974, The Smithsonian Library, which is as old as the Institution itself, has undergone careful in-house examination and assessment of its program and activities, aimed at refining its processes, maxi- mizing its resources and responding more promptly to the needs of the Institution and of the scholarly fraternity.",

    "195 and developing procedures for their conservation and restoration have all made major strides.",
    "Greater attention has been paid to the needs of Bureau libraries and to assisting them in responding more promptly and fully to the requirements of their constituency.",
    "Steps were taken which will lead to the complete cataloguing of the important library of the National Air and Space Museum by the dedication of its new building in July 1976.",
    "The Archives of the Institution, concerned primarily with its history and the history of scholarship within it, have been brought to virtually full intellectual control.",
    "Inventorying of archival re- sources has progressed and computer systems have been developed for their cataloguing in close cooperation with curatorial depart- ments and the central and bureau libraries.",
    "Conservation, an ever present, indeed a growing concern to all museums, has been further strengthened by enlarging the amount of space allotted to the Conservation Analytical Laboratory, by the purchase of more sensitive and highly specialized equipment, and by the active recruitment of additional staff members.",
    "In spite of the progress made, far more needs to be done.",
    "The present capacity is hardly able to keep up with immediate, emergency needs, let alone allow for the constant review required by such varied collections as those possessed by the Institution.",
    "To maxi- mize resources, avoid the possibilities of duplication, and to focus more clearly on the needs, a Conservation Council was created which regularly will assemble key conservators of all Smithsonian museums.",
    "In addition, the staff of the Conservation Analytical Laboratory has been active in assisting training organizations in developing, as rapidly as possible, the additional professionals which are urgently needed not only by the Institution but by museums throughout the country.",
    "Conservation is more than the monitoring of conditions and finding palliative methods to remedy the desecrations of time or of man.",
    "It is also basic research in the properties of materials and in the manners in which these materials have been assembled by nature or by man.",
    "The Conservation Analytical Laboratory has been under increasingly steady pressure to provide technical data to bolster the hypotheses of historical re- search or stylistic development.",
    "The processing of objects .either belonging to the Institution or sent to the Institution for study or exhibition has been thoroughly 196 / Smithsonian Year 1974 reorganized.",
    "A registration capability is being developed in each of the Smithsonian museums that did not have it so that each can achieve more expeditious and accurate control on the whereabouts of their holdings and, perhaps more important, monitor their con- ditions in more efficient ways.",
    "A Registrarial Council has been created to develop the required parameters.",
    "The foundations have been laid for the development of a Cen- tral Registrar's Office that will help coordinate the growth of the registrarial department in each of the museums, avoid duplications, attain coherence in methods, and help develop basic retrieval sys- tems which, eventually, may be coordinated with regional, national, or, indeed, international data networks.",
    "The collections of the Institution represent a data bank unequaled anywhere.",
    "The poten- tial of mastering a substantial portion of this wealth by the means of computers has already been demonstrated in discrete areas.",
    "Museums which are essential for the transmittal to the future of the heritage of the past must, however, be of service to the present.",
    "There is no contradiction in these terms as long as there is a clear understanding of goals and integrity in their pursuit.",
    "Exhibition is a key function for a museum.",
    "In this area, also a major reorganization has brought to each museum intellectual and physical control over the resources with which it can interpret its holdings.",
    "Certain museums and bureaus, either too small to have an exhibition resource of their own or that have too infrequent need for such specialized capabilities, are served by the recently developed Office of Exhibits Central.",
    "Some of its specialized shops, virtually unmatched for their abilities, particularly in the area of modeling and plastics, serve the entire family of Smithsonian museums.",
    "This office also has more general workshops which pro- vide design and construction capabilities to those units that do not have exhibit departments.",
    "The reorganization of the Office of Exhibits has led to closer cooperation between design and cura- torial staffs.",
    "The Office of Exhibits Central and the exhibit offices in various museums are contributing and participating in the psychological studies conducted by the Office of Museum Programs.",
    "These stud- ies are specifically designed to acquire more information about museums as a learning environment and to developing more re- sponsive methods for orientation of the museum visitor.",
    "These Museum Programs 1 197 studies, which are now coming to fruition, will undoubtedly result in new exhibit concepts and forms of presentation.",
    "Their timeliness is evident since the Institution is gearing toward an unprecedented efflorescence of exhibition activities which will culminate in the Bicentennial Year.",
    "For the past decade, the Institution has recognized that it had a duty to assist those less wealthy institutions around the country in presenting to their public a richer fare.",
    "This concern took on concrete and permanent form with the development of the Smith- sonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service.",
    "This has made available hundreds of exhibitions of high quality, at modest cost, to museums, historical societies, colleges, universities, and cultural centers.",
    "The efficacy of sites had, in the last few years, been increasingly jeopardized as costs increased and borrowing organi- zations were unable to assume the rental fees which were neces- sary for a break-even program.",
    "Federal funding of sites, for the first time in fiscal year 1974, has helped to maintain a balance.",
    "Between now and the end of the Bicentennial Year, approximately 250 new exhibitions will be developed on various subjects con- cerned with history, art, and science.",
    "Major emphasis has and will be given to incorporating into traveling exhibitions Smithsonian concepts and, where appropriate, objects so that the Institution's resources on the Mall can be shared more broadly with the Nation at large.",
    "Many of these new exhibitions will be built by the Office of Exhibits Central, to concepts and specifications provided by SITES.",
    "To increase the educational usefulness of these exhibitions, kits of educational materials, designed for schools, will be pre- pared and an increasingly large number of sites exhibitions will be accompanied by didactic materials which will be geared to vari- ous levels so that the broadest benefit can be derived by their presence.",
    "Assisting museums in developing the expertise of their staff or in solving special problems has been another historic service of the Institution.",
    "In the last few years, it has been rationalized by the Office of Museum Programs through the presentation of work- shops, available free of charge to museum personnel from across the country.",
    "This program, increased in effectiveness in 1974, will be broadened in the years ahead.",
    "Disseminating knowledge on conservation through expertly prepared series of slide lectures is 198 / Smithsonian Year 1974 another service recently developed.",
    "This will be supplemented by upward of 40 video-taped programs on the basic principles of con- servation and conservation practice.",
    "These programs will be avail- able to museums, historical societies, and other interested groups.",

    "Office of Museum Programs The Office of Museum Programs, as part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Museum Programs, is an aggregate of programs responsible for coordinating activities related to training 204 / Smithsonian Year 1974 in muscology and museography, and the development of new tech- niques relating to museum administration and practices.",
    "Presently, the office maintains three major programs \u2014 the Museum Work- shop Program, the Conservation Information Program, and the Psychological Studies Program.",
    "The Museum Workshop Program offers workshops, seminars, and training courses to any individual gainfully employed by a museum.",
    "Each workshop, taught by Smithsonian staff, is devoted to specific methods or problems.",
    "Enrollment is limited, and instruc- tors try to concentrate on the particular needs of each participant.",
    "Special attention is usually given to the problems of the small museum's budget, services, and facilities.",
    "Workshops offered this year featured: exhibit design, graphics techniques, silk screening, label writing, editing and production, fabrication and installation methods, model-making, freeze-drying, membership programs, traveling exhibitions, development and financial planning, and psychological methods.",
    "The Conservation Information Program is another service de- signed to make the knowledge and facilities of the Smithsonian accessible to as large an audience as possible.",
    "The program acquaints small museums, interested organizations, and individuals with selected theoretical and practical principles currently practiced in the field of museum conservation.",
    "This information \u2014 in the form of video-taped programs and slide lectures accompanied by tape commentaries \u2014 is lent, free of charge, to all who request it.",
    "To date, the Conservation Information Program, in cooperation with the Smithsonian Institution Conservation-Analytical Labora- tory, has produced 4 slide presentations on the curatorial care of objects and 10 more are being prepared during the next year.",
    "Some selected subjects include: dry methods in the cleaning of prints, drawings, and manuscripts; proper mounting and matting of drawings, and manuscripts; proper mounting and matting of paper; the protective lining of a wooden storage drawer for textiles and costumes; and the wet cleaning of antique cotton, linen and wool.",
    "The Psychological Studies Program provides both direct and evaluative services to the Smithsonian Institution and engages in applied behavior research for broader application to museum pro- fessional practices.",
    "The staff designs and tests museum behavior studies which aid (1) the study of the museum as an institution for Museum Programs I 205 the preservation, interpretation, and exhibition of objects, and (2) the construction of several practical and effective visitor-behavior projects employing some of the methods of social science that the museum professional can undertake in his own museum or gallery.",
    "The Psychological Studies Program analyzes visitor behavior, especially that of communication.",
    "Investigations gauge the educa- tional effectiveness of exhibits and exhibit techniques.",
    "The Program is also concerned with the problem of visitor orientation, that is, how to initiate the visitor into the museum experience for optimum use of his time and interests.",
    "The primary testing grounds for research activities have been the National Museum of Natural History, the National Museum of History and Technology, and the Renwick Gallery of the National Collection of Fine Arts.",
    "Subjects examined in nmnh were: the relative effectiveness of different ex- hibit halls; visitor characteristics most likely to determine visitor behavior; and the relationship between the physical layout, famil- iarity and attractiveness of exhibit halls, and the visitors' behavior within them.",
    "At nmht, the staff analyzed traffic flow, crowding, attraction and holding power of exhibits, orientation within the gallery, the effectiveness of different kinds of labels, use of facili- ties, and causes of visitor fatigue.",
    "Visitor learning and ways of facilitating it were tested for two years at the Renwick.",
    "Office of the Registrar The Smithsonian is evaluating and improving its registration sys- tem.",
    "The Office of the Registrar, which dates back at least to the 1880s once kept records on all specimens and administered all shipping for the Smithsonian.",
    "New museums, increases in curatorial staff, and increased accession rates have outpaced the development of the Central Registrar's office.",
    "Presently actions are underway to break with old traditions.",
    "During 1973, the Council of Registrars, which represents most museums in the Smithsonian complex, made thorough studies of several registration problems and made exten- sive reports to the Assistant Secretary for Museum Programs.",
    "These recommendations are the initial steps toward beneficial change in the Institution's registration system.",
    "206 / Smithsonian Year 1974 Although yet a vision rather than a reaUty, the new order of registration at the Smithsonian is discernible, and it is the goal toward which present activities are directed.",
    "Each museum will have a registration staff adequate to ensure proper documentation of all acquisitions and to work with curators and conservators to ensure the security and availability of specimens.",
    "The Central Registrar will have several functions.",
    "As the senior registrar, he will assist museums with their registration problems and he will develop new registration techniques as required by the complexities of the national collections.",
    "Most important of all, the Central Registrar will take an Institution-wide view of the national collec- tions and the systems which protect and service these resources.",
    "Thus, the primary achievement of fiscal year 1974 was careful development of goals.",
    "Smithsonian Institution Archives During fiscal 1974 the Smithsonian Archives continued its efforts to gain intellectual control of Archives throughout the Institution.",
    "Work continued on records of the National Museum of Natural His- tory, where an intensive survey revealed that some 6.5 million docu- ments remain unprocessed and in need of archival preservation.",
    "The National Museum of History and Technology presents an archival challenge unique among Smithsonian bureaus, because it is the only bureau which maintains a major manuscript collecting program in addition to creating its own administrative records.",
    "During 1974 the Archives staff began a major effort to aid in the care and preservation of those materials.",
    "A consultant employed by the Archives surveyed the records and manuscript holdings of the Science and Technology Department, and submitted a report to the Director of the National Museum of History and Technology, which will serve as the basis for policy decisions defining the role of the Archives in the National Museum of History and Technology.",
    "The Archives made provisions to care for the records of the National Collection of Fine Arts and the National Portrait Gallery, as well as the National Air and Space Museum.",
    "Museum Programs I 207 Many other ongoing programs continued, with emphasis on mi- crofilming and efforts to develop computerized finding aids to the Archives' holdings.",
    "Arrangement and microfilming of the accession records continued and the specimen catalogues of several divisions in the National Museum of Natural History were filmed.",
    "Smithsonian Institution Libraries Nineteen seventy-four was a year of staff participation and a year of experimentation in new forms of operations and services.",
    "During the first half of the year the Libraries' staff took part in a study of the Libraries' management.",
    "A report was submitted to the Director of Libraries in January 1974, and after discussions with the staff, the Director of Libraries accepted more than fifty of the study's recommendations.",
    "The recommendations are being implemented by the Libraries' administrators.",
    "An Implementation Assessment Group, appointed to monitor the progress of implementation, is to make periodic reports to the Director of Libraries and to the staff.",
    "This management study introduced an atmosphere of staff partici- pation in decision making.",
    "The most promising technical development was the Libraries' experiment with the Ohio College Library Center (oclc) on-line cataloguing system.",
    "This system produces catalogue cards for- matted to Smithsonian specifications faster and more efficiently than the previously used manual procedures.",
    "Furthermore, the oclc system, which provides on-line access to a large and growing bibliographic data base, has facilitated the process of ordering library materials.",
    "The introduction of this system has effected some experiments in workflow and staffing patterns to permit more efficient use of personnel.",
    "The staff is now assessing the effective- ness of the OCLC system and is planning for expansion of automated systems.",
    "Throughout the year, bureau and branch librarians met to dis- cuss common problems.",
    "For the first time, librarians responsible for the development and maintenance of library collections in various bureaus and departments participated in the allocation of book and binding funds for the Libraries.",
    "The Deputy Assistant Director for 208 / Smithsonian Year 1974 Bureau Services has initiated cooperative efforts to formulate a library collection development policy for the Institution.",
    "Services to users have been augmented.",
    "For example, the National Air and Space Museum Library produces a current aware- ness list; users in the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and Radiation Biology Laboratory Libraries are provided with individ- ually profiled current awareness services; librarians at the National Zoological Park and Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute index relevant literature for their users.",
    "Librarians serving bureaus and departments of the Institution have been attempting to become more closely involved with pro- grams and plans of the bureaus which they serve.",
    "The National Air and Space Museum librarian serves as Chairperson of the NASM Collection Development Committee; both the National Air and Space Museum and National Collection of Fine Arts/National Portrait Gallery librarians attend staff meetings held by their bureau directors; at the request of the National Museum of History and Technology librarian, a library committee of curators has been formed to advise the bureau librarian.",
    "In spite of a limited budget for the purchase of books and journals, the Libraries continued to acquire many of the materials required to support Smithsonian Institution programs.",
    "To a large extent, important gifts and the Libraries' well-established exchange program made this possible.",
    "The year saw exchange programs initiated with the People's Republic of China and with the Museums and Monuments Office in Ghana.",
    "The binding and preservation program of the Libraries has been hampered for a number of years by lack of adequate funds.",
    "In anticipation of increased support, binding and preservation needs have been assessed.",
    "The program to identify and preserve rare books in the Institution continued.",
    "One area of concern expressed in the Libraries' management study was the personnel program.",
    "As a result, some changes in personnel policies and staffing are being tested and a Staff Develop- ment Committee has been appointed.",
    "The Libraries supported staff participation in continuing educa- tion and professional activities such as seminars, conferences, meetings, and training courses.",
    "Twenty-six Libraries' staff members Museum Programs I 209 attended training courses funded by the Libraries.",

    "Smithsonian Year '1974 PUBLIC SERVICE During the past 12 months an exciting fermentation has begun in the area of Public Service.",
    "This activity is in response to the impact of a larger public interest in a more extensive Smithsonian Institu- tion, and, in equal measure, to a notably more discerning public interest in the educational potential of the Smithsonian museums and galleries, and their programs.",
    "In building the resources and the organization to meet these challenges, the Public Service divisions are helping to bring into balance the Institution's fulfillment of Mr. Smithson's mandate for the diffusion of knowledge as well as its increase.",
    "For, basically, the role of Public Service is education, and Smith- sonian educational activity has been mushrooming as the desire of the American public of all ages to be educated has burgeoned in one of the liveliest social phenomena of our time.",
    "During the year, 21 Smithsonian bureaus conducted specifically educational programs which reached a total of close to 300,000 people.",
    "These were by no means all Public Service functions, but all complemented the direct educational role of the Office of Public Service.",
    "Our view, in fact, is that our major museum and gallery directors are the best qualified to develop education programs related to their collections or re- searches.",
    "In consequence, we decentralized the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education and thereby made people and money avail- able for the establishment of education speciahst positions and sup- porting sections in all of the principal museums and galleries.",
    "A comparable reorganization is being considered for the Office of Public Affairs; in addition, the funds formerly allotted to the Smith- sonian Institution Press and divided by the Director of the Press among interested bureaus will henceforth be distributed directly to 217 bureau chiefs so that each may determine his own publishing priori- ties.",
    "Such changes permit us to reorganize the central offices of the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education and ultimately of the Office of PubHc Affairs so that their efforts can be focused on Institution-wide requirements.",
    "The twin challenges posed by Smithsonian growth and by the ap- proach of the Bicentennial have stimulated every one of the Public Service divisions, as will be evident in the following accounts.",
    "At the end of fiscal 1974 Smithsonian (magazine) circulation and Na- tional Associate membership exceeded 600,000 and was steadily climbing; Resident Associate membership topped 20,000; Division of Performing Arts-produced Smithsonian Collection of Classic Jazz had sold 30,000 copies; and a striking further demonstration of public enthusiasm for Office of Public Service programs was evident in the long queues which formed before each of the 7 daily show- ings of the Ascent of Man film series, arranged by the Office of PubUc Service Free Film Theatre.",
    "In addition, not only the Public Service bureaus but the entire Institution is preparing for the antici- pated results of the Smithsonian television series which will begin in the fall of 1974 and will bring Smithsonian treasures and Smith- sonian interests to 20 to 40 million television viewers across the Nation.",
    "Every increase in public interest in the Smithsonian gener- ates a requirement for service to that public, whether it be the development of new educational facilities or simply the organization and staffing of an office to reply to the increase in letters of inquiry or suggestion addressed to the Smithsonian.",
    "Fiscal year 1974 did bring one reduction in the organizational makeup of the Office of Public Service with the very appropriate transfer of the Office of International Activities to the Office of the Secretary for Science.",
    "Finally, the Office of Public Services wishes to express its warm appreciation to the 1120 dedicated members of the Smithsonian vol- unteers and the 530 Smithsonian volunteer docents who gave so much of their time and service to the Institution during 1974, and without whose help \"Smithsonian Public Service\" would have a far more limited connotation.",

    "The desired objective of improving security at these outlying establish- ments is realized by the permanent assignment of personnel who make daily supervisory inspections of every location on each relief.",
    "The supervisors also are responsible for inspecting the quality of security at separate locations where protection is carried out pri- vately by the occupants or by contract security agencies.",
    "As addi- 260 / Smithsonian Year 1974 tional facilities are established that are not large enough to warrant activation of a new guard company, they too will be added to the Outpost Detachment's area of responsibility.",
    "All first- and second-line supervisors have completed the equal employment opportunity supervisory training course.",
    "During the year, through reassignment and/or employment, 26 women were accepted for employment as security guards.",
    "I SUPPLY DIVISION The Supply Division continued to experience increased procure- ment and contracting work loads primarily due to the general ex- pansion of the Smithsonian Institution and its many related activi- ties, and all indications point to future accelerated growth in both of these responsibilities.",
    "The major procurements for the new Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden were accomplished during the year.",
    "Contracting is well under way for the special requirements and exhibits planned for the National Air and Space Museum which will open in 1976.",
    "The Division also assumed responsibility for all construction contracted during the year, and its most significant accomplishment was the contract for major renovation of the Arts and Industries building which was in progress at year's end.",
    "The Division continued to be an active participant in the acquisi- tion of useful excess Government property to satisfy the needs of the Institution's many organization units.",
    "Excess property acquired this year was more than $500,000.",

    "Financial Services \u25a0 The Treasurer has overall responsibility for the financial assets of I the Smithsonian Institution.",
    "This includes the budgeting and ac- counting of federal appropriations, the fiscal administration of grants and contracts, and the monitoring of revenue-producing ; activities; further detail on these activities is given in the reports- which follow on the Office of Programming and Budget, the Ac- counting Division, the Grants and Insurance Administration Divi- sion, and the Business Management Office.",
    "Working closely with the Investment Policy Committee of the Board of Regents, the Treasurer oversees the management of the' endowment funds of the Institution by three professional advisory firms, and is also responsible for the short-term investment of cur- rent funds excess to immediate operating needs.",
    "Details on these funds and the other financial resources of the Institution can be found in the Financial Report at the front of this volume.",
    "OFFICE OF PROGRAMMING AND BUDGET The Office of Programming and Budget participates in program plan- , ning for the Institution and, to carry out these plans, is responsible | for the formulation, presentation, implementation, and review of operating and construction budgets of appropriated and nonappro- priated funds.",

    "262 / Smithsonian Year 1974 During the year, the staff of seven persons engaged in the follow- ing activities.",
    "Detailed fiscal 1974 operating budgets and associated staffing plans for both federal and nonfederal funds were developed with some 75 individual organization units and programs.",
    "These ranged from the major museums and research laboratories to small service and staff offices.",
    "Subsequently, throughout the year, these budgets and plans were monitored and reviewed with the perform- ing units to assure that program plans were accomplished within approved amounts.",
    "The uncertainty at the beginning of the year as to whether several legislated pay raises would be financed with sup- plemental appropriations required special efforts to assure the wisest application of financial resources.",
    "Based on the decision reached at the February 1973 Belmont Con- I ference on Goals and Priorities (in which the Office was heavily involved) that emphasis must be given to strengthening the support 1 functions of the Institution, such as collections conservation and , protection of buildings, the Office developed and presented to the President's Office of Management and Budget a completely revised format for the fiscal year 1975 budget.",
    "As compared with the tradi- tional organizational unit presentation, the new format was pro- grammatic in nature designed to show clearly the base capability and resource requirements of the support functions as well as the equally high priority of our Bicentennial Program commitments.",
    "This budget presentation was received very favorably by the Office of Management and Budget and resulted in the Smithsonian being allowed to seek substantial additional appropriations for these needs from the Congress.",
    "The Office of Programming and Budget prepared and submitted to the Congress budget justifications and supporting documentation and prepared for and participated in the budget hearings before the House and Senate Appropriation Committees.",
    "Similar work was carried out on the fiscal year 1974 pay supple- mental appropriation.",
    "At the same time, the Office of Programming and Budget devel- oped a more formal system for planning and goal-setting by each Smithsonian organization unit \u2014 now required by the expansion of the Institution, by the increasingly decentralized nature of much of its activity, and by the growing complexity of administering its diversified organizations.",
    "Administrative Management I 263 In addition to the above Institution-wide responsibilities, the Office of Programming and Budget also engaged in a number of special projects.",
    "It was involved intensively in the formulation and management review of fiscal years 1974 and 1975 budgets for the proposed Millwood Museum.",

    "Continuing the accounting services improvement program during fiscal 1974, the Accounting Division staff initiated and, with the assistance of other offices, conducted seminars on time-keeping and payroll, procurement and payment procedures, travel and voucher- ing procedures, and financial reporting.",
    "These seminars were at- tended by 200 Smithsonian administrative personnel including officers, assistants, clerks, and secretaries.",
    "With the assistance of our computer specialists, the Accounting staff installed a key-to- disc data entry system to replace an inefficient card and paper tape system eliminating repetitious data processing and adding beneficial controls.",
    "The new system became operational May 1, 1974, with full implementation projected January 1, 1975.",
    "Additionally, installation in fiscal year 1974 of a new personnel time reporting procedure is also serving to speed and improve accuracy of payroll preparation.",
    "GRANTS AND INSURANCE ADMINISTRATION DIVISION The Grants and Insurance Administration Division is responsible for administration of gifts, grants, and contracts received by the Institution.",
    "In addition, this Division administers the Institution's risk management and insurance program.",
    "The Division provides administrative, management, and fiscal services to Smithsonian re- searchers and the business representatives of granting agencies, as 264 / Smithsonian Year 1974 well as the controls necessary to assure that funds are expended in accordance with appropriate regulations and contract terms.",
    "During the past year the Division has continued its excellent ad- ministration in the gift, grant, and contract area and at the same time has expanded its operations in the risk management and insur- ance area.",
    "This expansion has entailed the initiation of risk manage- ment surveys of various organizations and bureaus of the Smith- sonian to identify risk and recommend ways of alleviating and protecting against such risks.",
    "In addition, collections insurance cov- erages throughout the Institution have been consolidated, resulting in reduced work loads and the saving of considerable funds through premium reductions.",
    "BUSINESS MANAGEMENT OFFICE In addition to having overall responsibility for the Museum Shops, the Product Development Program and the Belmont Conference Center, which are described below, the Business Management Office also advises other Smithsonian bureaus on the negotiation and monitoring of revenue-producing concessions and contracts.",
    "During the past year, for example.",
    "Business Management assisted on such diverse projects as the contracts for educational sound systems in the National Museum of Natural History and the Hirshhorn Mu- seum, the competitive solicitation of food service and parking con- cessionaires for the new National Air and Space Museum, and the construction of a new restaurant in the National Collection of Fine Arts and National Portrait Gallery building.",
    "The efforts of this office are an important element in the improvement of the Institution's nonfederal resources.",
    "Museum Shops The past year was one of growth and change for the Museum Shops.",
    "For the first time sales climbed above $2 million, and net income reached the quarter-million mark.",
    "More importantly, 1974 saw the laying of groundwork which will produce far greater benefits to our Museums and visitors in the future.",
    "Recognizing that the Shops should provide a means for a visitor to extend his museum experience, selection and display of merchan- dise has been drastically changed to provide increased educational values and a greater reflection of the museum in which a shop is Administrative Management I 265 located.",
    "A leading architectural firm with extensive museum experi- ence was retained to redesign completely the main shop in the National Museum of History and Technology \u2014 a project scheduled for completion by December 1974.",
    "A number of important organizational changes were also made, with each shop manager being delegated responsibility for a specific area.",
    "A new position of Controller was created to provide greater inventory control and reports for management guidance.",
    "The Dis- play Department was reorganized, and a new position was created in the Buying Department.",
    "Product Development Program The Product Development Program originated from efforts to im- prove the quality and relevance of items handled in the Museum Shops and as a means to bring to audiences other than the Smithsonian's Washington visitors the educational values of the Institution.",
    "As a part of this program.",
    "Tonka Corporation \u2014 a leading U.S. toy manufacturer with whom an agreement has been in effect since 1972, and under which it will manufacture and sell, in close coordi- nation with Smithsonian, a line of museum-related products \u2014 in- troduced in fiscal year 1974 a series of diorama kits with a Smithso- nian theme.",
    "These hobby/craft products effectively enable the builder to recapture a moment in history by creating an entire scene.",
    "Each kit is accompanied by a 24-page booklet containing detailed information on the historical period.",
    "Similar agreements were reached during fiscal 1974 with three additional corporations.",
    "The first of these was with the Fieldcrest Company, which is developing bedspreads, quilts, comforters, blan- kets, sheets, and towels based on designs found in the Smithsonian collection items.",
    "Its trade introduction in May was well received, and products will reach the market in the fall of 1974.",
    "Another agree- ment was with the Stieff Company for a line of silver and pewter reproductions.",

    "Belmont Conference Center The Belmont Conference Center, located between the District of Columbia and Baltimore near Interstate 95, provides an attractive, secluded, gracious, and exclusive retreat unusual in the Eastern Cor- ridor.",
    "Its easy access to the Baltimore-Washington airports, as well as to automotive arteries, impresses upon its guests the enjoyable paradox of a rural setting with the conveniences of urban proximity but without its complexities.",
    "One of the major advantages of Bel- mont is its use by only one group at any one time; schedules are so arranged as to avoid the overlap and attendant discomforts often encountered in other conference centers and hotels.",
    "Since its open- ing in 1967, conference operations have been directed toward the needs of small groups which require a location unencumbered by the normal intrusions associated with offices.",
    "The 240-year-old manor house, with 365 surrounding acres of lawns, forests, and fields, provides a working retreat for the productive groups which keep returning to the Center.",
    "f Belmont can accommodate 24 in-house residents, with facilities for 10 to 12 additional guests, speakers, or observers for meals and meeting sessions.",
    "This limiting size factor ensures that each confer- ence has the undivided and individual attention of the entire staff, as well as the opportunity for unusually close interaction within the meeting group itself.",
    "Of the 80 or so meetings which Belmont hosts in a year, approximately 60 percent are from federally-funded agen- cies; the balance includes those from foundations and other philcin- thropic organizations, professional, religious, and social groups, corporations and private industry, and universities and colleges.",
    "Office of Audits During fiscal year 1974, the Office of Audits issued audit reports on the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum, the Smithsonian Research Foundation, the National Zoological Park, the Chesapeake Bay Cen- ter for Environmental Studies, Mail Management, the Mediterranean Administrative Management I 267 n\u00bbM i?iij 1 Belmont Conference Center.",

    "In addition, the Office of Audits completed various pre-award and post-audits of contracts, and closed out 26 foreign currency grants in the amount of $1 million.",
    "International Exchange Service The International Exchange Service is the one program bureau in the support activities group.",
    "In 1851, the Smithsonian Institution established the international exchange system to provide a means for exchanging current Smithsonian publications for the trans- actions and proceedings of institutions in other countries.",
    "Other learned bodies in the United States were allowed to participate by exchanging their publications with those of foreign organizations.",
    "This program has continued through the years and, by this method, many colleges, universities, scientific societies, and medical and dental libraries exchange their current and duplicate publications with similar organizations in other countries.",
    "During the year, over 700,000 pounds of publications were re- ceived from more than 250 organizations in the United States for transmission through the Service to over 100 countries.",
    "Publica- tions weighing approximately 500,000 pounds were forwarded by ocean freight to 38 exchange bureaus in 32 countries.",
    "Approxi- mately 250,000 pounds of publications were mailed to the intended recipients in countries that do not have exchange bureaus.",

    "Administrative Management I 269 Smithsonian Women's Council The Smithsonian Women's Council was established by the Secre- tary in 1972 to represent to the Smithsonian's leadership the con- cerns of women at the Institution regarding employment and related matters.",
    "During its first full term of existence in 1973-1974, the Council undertook several major projects.",
    "Its Child-care Committee acted on indications from employees that employer child-care assistance was of concern to them and on the evidence that Smithsonian resources could make special contributions to the development and education of children in general through progams conducted for employees' children.",
    "Based on information from a wide variety of sources, the Women's Council prepared a proposal in the fall of 1973 for an experimental program, providing for hiring a spe- cialist in child care and development programming.",
    "After an initial assignment of designing an information-exchange service for em- ployees concerned with child care, the specialist would move on rapidly to the development and execution of a summer educational program for school-age children and finally the presentation of recommendations for the Smithsonian's future role in the care and education of its employees' children.",
    "Administrative and finan- cial elements were settled during the following winter and in the late spring of 1974 recruiting for the position of Child-care Coor- dinator began.",
    "The Assistant Secretary for Public Service assumed overall responsibility for the program with assistance from an ad- visory board representing the Women's Council and the Offices of Museum Programs, Personnel Administration, Equal Oppor- tunity, and the Treasurer.",
    "Another Council committee, formed to study patterns of recruit- ment, employment, and promotion at the Smithsonian, analyzed the Smithsonian's Merit Promotion Program and the skills-file method currently in use in internal recruiting for clerical and sec- retarial positions and offered recommendations for elimination of inequities in these systems and improvement of their operation.",
    "The report and recommendations were submitted to the Directors of Personnel Administration and Equal Opportunity in April 1974.",
    "Other committees of the Council have been and are engaged in widely varied activities.",
    "One conducted studies and analysis of the 270 / Smithsonian Year 1974 : Institution's Upward Mobility Program and submitted to Person- nel Administration and Equal Opportunity recommendations for significant changes and expansion in that area.",
    "Another committee sponsored a lecture on \"The Job Jungle\" by career-development expert Alexander Methven, which drew 170 employees and guests.",

STEVENS, CHAIRMAN Faced with the perennial challenge of surpassing previous efforts, the Kennedy Center opened its third season with an unprecedented four-week festival: Shakespeare and the Performing Arts.",
    "In keep- ing with basic philosophy that Center festivals must make an artistic statement of unique importance, the month-long celebration was designed to illustrate Shakespeare's profound influence on all as- pects of the performing arts.",
    "Utilizing virtually every part of the building, the festival included drama, dance, opera, symphony and chamber concerts, jazz, and film.",
    "The Center's unique structure, with four theaters under one roof, provided an extraordinary opportunity for comparative study, as, for example, Macbeth was presented in its traditional dramatic form in the Eisenhower Theater, while Verdi's operatic adaptation was simultaneously staged in the Opera House, and two different film interpretations were offered in the American Film Institute Theater.",
    "Similarly, readings from Shakespeare were coupled with stunning ballet passages they have inspired.",
    "During a special opening salute, activity extended even beyond the walls of the Center, as Handel's Water Music was performed antiphonally by musicians on the river terrace and on a barge afloat the Potomac.",
    "Participating in the festival were such outstanding performers as Dame Peggy Ashcrof t. Sir Michael Redgrave, Maurice Evans, Zoe Caldwell, Christopher Plummer, Charlton Heston, Natalia Maka- rova, and Cleo Laine.",

    "Audience support surpassed all previous years as over 1.7 million people attended performances, and the vitality of the performing arts in Washington was graphically illustrated by the fact that the Opera House was in full operation for 50 weeks, the Eisenhower Theater for 52 weeks, and the Concert Hall for 52 weeks.",
    "The season ultimately included: 125 performances of dance, by distinguished companies from around the world; 160 symphony concerts, including 129 by the resident National Symphony Orches- tra; 42 performances of 15 operas; 37 recitals; 30 chamber concerts; 23 choral concerts; 44 concerts of popular music, folk, jazz, and rock; and 671 performances of drama and musical comedy.",

    "In addition to return engagements of the American Ballet Theatre and the National Ballet, the Center welcomed for the first time the New York City Ballet and Britain's Royal Ballet.",
    "Theatrical highlights included a standing-room-only, post-Broad- , way engagement of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire, with Lois Nettleton and Alan Feinstein; shattering performances by Colleen Dewhurst and Jason Robards in Eugene O'Neill's A Moon for the Misbegotten, directed by Tony Award-winner Jose Quintero; Deborah Kerr's recreation of her London triumph in Frank Harvey's The Day After the Fair; David Turner's The Prodigal Daughter, starring Wilfred Hyde-White; Kate Reid's moving performance in Brian Friel's The Freedom of the City; Anthony Quayle's powerful portrayal of a contemporary Russian writer in Henry Denker's The Headhunters; the premiere of Erich Maria Remarque's Full Circle, directed by Otto Preminger; and Samuel Taylor's delightful comedy.",
    "Perfect Pitch, with Tammy Grimes and Jean-Pierre \\ Aumont.",
    "In a unique arrangement, and what is hoped will prove the first ' of many such examples of mutual cooperation between the Center and American colleges and universities, the entire cast of The Head- hunters spent a week performing at the University of Tennessee, prior to opening in Washington.",
    "During their stay in Knoxville, ' 280 / Smithsonian Year 1974 director-star Anthony Quayle and others associated with the pro- duction conducted a series of seminars and workshops which were open to the entire academic community.",
    "Of particular significance was the fact that students and faculty of the drama department were able to observe work on professional production, prior to its opening in their theater.",
    "The most significant theatrical event of the season, and the Cen- ter's most ambitious undertaking since the 1971 opening of Leonard Bernstein's Mass, was the American premiere of Tom Stoppard's Jumpers.",
    "In a dazzling display, Stoppard combined both physical and philosophical gymnastics to produce one of the most literate and entertaining plays the theater has witnessed in the past decade.",
    "Directed by Peter Wood and starring Brian Bedford and Jill Clay- burgh, Jumpers played the Eisenhower for an unprecedented eight weeks and went on to a limited Broadway engagement.",
    "During the course of the season, the Center also presented a delightful series of musicals \u2014 including revivals of two classics : The Pajama Game, with Barbara McNair, Cab Calloway, and Hal Linden, and Good News, with Alice Faye and John Payne \u2014 Stephen Sondheim's award-winning A Little Night Music, and a highly successful engagement of / Do!",

    "Of particular artistic importance was the presentation in May of a three-week Mozart Festival, conceived and developed by the Center's Music Director, Julius Rudel.",
    "A series of 44 performances, 14 of which were free, illustrated the full range of Mozart's genius and featured both familiar works and lesser known, rarely per- formed selections.",
    "Highlighting the festival was the American premiere of a revised edition of the opera Idomeneo.",
    "In a special community outreach, festival programming included a number of outstanding concerts at the Smithsonian and in area churches, and in conjunction with the Center's activities, the Music Critics Association conducted institutes dealing with Mozart authen- ticity, special Mozart performance problems, and Mozart opera.",
    "The following month, in a dramatic three-century leap, the Cen- ter played host to Art Now '74, a celebration of contemporary American art and artists.",

    "j Throughout the year, the Center's vitally important educational Irole expanded through the continued growth of the Alliance for Arts Education (aae).",
    "The Alliance, a joint project of the Center and the Office of Education, Department of Health, Education and Welfare, was established in 1973, to make the Center's programs, facilities, and services more accessible to students as participants and per- formers; to stimulate, at local, state, and regional levels, quality jprograms in which all the arts are included as an integral part of !",
    "the education of all students; and to establish the Center as a focal point for strengthening the arts in education at all levels.",
    "With the support of representatives of the President's Advisory Committee on the Arts, the Friends of the Kennedy Center, and national, state, and local officials, the Alliance established com- mittees in over 40 states.",
    "These state committees provide a forum and a communication center for arts and education organizations iworking to achieve the objectives of aae programs.",
    "In the fall of 1973, a Center-hosted aae conference provided a unique oppor- tunity for significant exchange between educators and arts adminis- trators from all 50 states.",
    "As a part of an Alliance \"showcase\" series, several states pre- sented outstanding representative educational programs at the Center during the spring.",
    "These included an appearance of the Golden Spike Youth Orchestra of Utah, a poets-in-the-schools project from New York, an exhibition of photographs and poems by Sioux Indian children of South Dakota, and a workshop on the arts jfor the mentally retarded.",
    "A total of 17 showcase activities are scheduled for the summer of 1974.",

    "In cooperation with the Music Educators National Conference, the AAE is developing plans for an American University Music Festival, to be similar in scope to the College Theatre Festival.",
    "Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts I 283 In addition to its AAE-oriented activities, the Center welcomed over 55,000 Washington-area school children to a series of special performances sponsored by the wives of Cabinet members and performing arts organizations within the city.",
    "The ongoing Special Ticket Program enabled over 135,000 people to attend regular Center performances at half-price.",
    "The program, which is available to students, the handicapped, retired people living on fixed incomes, limited-income groups, and military per- sonnel in grades E-1 through E-4, reflects the Center's concern that its performances be accessible to all, regardless of economic circumstances.",
    "Under the chairmanship of Mrs. J. Willard Marriott, the 121- member President's Advisory Committee on the Arts continued to advise and assist in Center activities.",
    "During the year, the Advisory Committee was particularly active in fund-raising activities and in the development of the Alliance for Arts Education.",
    "The Friends of the Kennedy Center, established as an auxiliary organization in 1966, grew to include over 10,000 members from all parts of the country.",
    "Volunteers from the Friends have gener- ously contributed thousands of hours of time and effort, con- ducting public tours, managing souvenir stands, and providing hospitality and other services to Center operations and functions.",
    "Working closely with the National Park Service, the Friends have provided visitor services to over two million sightseers annually.",
    "Activities of the Friends are directed by Mrs, Polk Guest, who has served as chairman since 1967.",
    "Charged by Congress with responsibility for maintaining the Center as a national memorial, the National Park Service has car- ried out vital maintenance, security, and information functions.",
    "The daily efforts of National Park Service personnel within the building and throughout the 17-acre site add immeasurably to the enjoyment of sightseers and theatergoers alike.",
    "During its three years of operation, the Center has housed com- panies headed by universally recognized theatrical personalities as well as little-known college ensembles.",
    "Plays, operas, and ballets have been created and molded within its walls.",
    "As the fourth season approaches, with concrete plans and ambitious goals reach- ing well into the future, the Center and its role as a living memorial continue to evolve.",
    "284 / Smithsonian Year 1974 Although organizationally a bureau of the Smithsonian, the Cen- ter is administered separately by a 45-member Board of Trustees, composed of 30 members appointed by the President to ten-year overlapping terms, 9 members, ex officio, from pertinent Federal and District of Columbia agencies, 3 members appointed from the Senate, and 3 from the House of Representatives.",

    "Smithsonian Year '1974 WOODROW WILSON INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR SCHOLARS JAMES BILLINGTON, DIRECTOR Late in 1968, the Congress determined that the official national memorial to the 28th President of the United States should be \u2014 uniquely among monuments to heads of state anywhere in the world so far as we are aware \u2014 a \"living memorial.\"",
    "The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars seeks to commemorate both the scholarly depth and the public concerns of Wilson through a program of advanced research and communi- cation between the world of ideas and the world of affairs.",
    "Center activities and aims can be discussed in terms of the three basic ingredients of higher learning in a democracy: people, ideas, and communication \u2014 people who can think, ideas that matter, and communication that gets through.",
    "PEOPLE Finding and supporting the gifted individual to conduct research on subjects of fundamental importance is the primary concern of the Center.",
    "The majority of Center fellows are selected on the basis of open competitions, which are held twice yearly.",
    "Last year the program accommodated 48 fellows and 5 guest scholars from 14 countries.",
    "Since the Center commenced its activities three years ago, it has welcomed 118 fellows from 27 countries for ranging scholarly research, along with 34 shorter-term guest scholars.",
    "The Center has had almost as many foreign as American fellows \u2014 bringing them together in a small group of no more than 40 at any 287 given time.",
    "If the company and its perspective are global, the scale is human and the enterprise hopefully humane.",
    "In its selection procedures the Center relies deeply on panels whose composition reflects the fact that higher scholarship in America is heavily concentrated in universities.",
    "Fellowships are not, however, confined to academics and are not designed for the perfection of narrow specialties or private languages.",
    "Any scholar with a major project in view that can make fruitful use of the rich resources of the Washington area is welcome to apply.",
    "Fellow- ships are awarded by three broad divisional panels: Natural Re- sources and Political Economy; Social Studies; and Historical and Cultural Studies.",
    "IDEAS Since the Center is free from traditional academic calendars and departmental structures and deals only in free, individual research, the opportunities are rich for the imaginative and cross-disciplinary scholar and for a creative mix of specialties and backgrounds.",
    "The Center is attempting to encourage depth in its scholarship by focus- ing on the historical, philosophical, and comparative dimensions of questions that matter for civilization.",
    "Much of the work at the Center has taken place in special subject areas within the broader scholarly divisions \u2014 research on pat- terns of sustainable economic growth and on the law of the sea and uses of the oceans within the division of natural resources and political economy, and studies of problems of the international order and the American system of government within the social studies division.",
    "Two new special programs in the latter division will bring (1) distinguished historians from abroad to work in Washington on the American Revolution as a world event, and (2) thoughtful practitioners from state and local governments in the United States to write a series of studies on the problems and prospects of the American federal system.",
    "While there are clusters of scholars with such common interests, the unifying force within the Center is the common scholarly com- mitment of fellows, guest s'cholars, and senior staff alike to what Wilson himself once described as \"the passionate search for dis- passionate truth.\"",
    "288 / Smithsonian Year 1974 COMMUNICATION Attempts to communicate between the world of ideas and the world of public affairs arise from the commission to serve as a \"living memorial\" to a President who bridged both worlds.",
    "The Center has the opportunity to perform a kind of switchboard function, making connections between the research materials of the Washington area, people at the Center, and the public sector in Washington.",
    "On the basis of past experience and present assets, the Center has sought recently to encourage both broadened dialogue between scholarship and the public sector and expanded use of the un- matched scholarly resources of the Washington area.",
    "Evening dia- logues, colloquia on work in progress, and occasional conferences are sponsored by the Center as ways of communicating scholarship within and beyond the Washington community \u2014 above and be- yond the publishing of the scholarly writings undertaken and produced by Center fellows.",
